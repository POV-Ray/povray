///
/// The following macros evaluate to the minimum and maximum values that could theoretically be
/// stored in an integer of the specified width, presuming that two's complement format is used for
/// negatives, regardless of what data type and negative number format the compiler and runtime
/// environment actually support.
///
/// @impl
/// @parblock
///     Care must be taken when specifying negative integer constants. According to the C++ standard
///     there is no such thing as a negative integer literal, only non-negative integer literals
///     negated by applying the unary minus operator applied; this is ok as long as the value is
///     given in decimal and the absolute value fits into a `long int` (which is guaranteed for
///     values up to 2^31-1), in which case the standard mandates that the literal is automatically
///     considered signed, and signed types must be able to hold negative values as least as small
///     as the negative of the largest positive value they can represent. However, if the absolute
///     value exceeds the capacity of a `long int` the behaviour is undefined, so the literal may
///     be interpreted as an unsigned value. In that case applying the unary minus operator will
///     still yield a positive result.
///
///     We work around this issue by first explicitly casting such literals to a fitting `POV_INTn`
///     type before applying the unary minus operator. Properly configured, those types also
///     guarantee that the expression (-POV_INTn(x)-1) does not overflow for positive x (as long as
///     x fits in the type), which is not generally guaranteed for signed integer types.
///
///     Note that as a consequence, such constants can not be utilized in preprocessor statements.
