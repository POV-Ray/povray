///     This header file is _not_ explicitly included in any source file (except @ref vm/precomp.cpp
///     which is designed to allow for precompiling this header in the first place). To use
///     precompiled headers, you will therefore have to make your build environment automatically
///     inject this header at the start of every source file.
///
///     The rationale behind this is to keep the set of headers included in each source file at an
///     absolute minimum when precompiled headers are _not_ used.
