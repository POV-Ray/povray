POV-Ray 3.7 for PC-Linux, binary version (povlinux.tgz) - README file

For the binary distribution for PC-Linux
===============================================================================

This is the README file for the compiled version of POV-Ray 3.7 for
PC-Linux.  Platform specific instructions for POV-Ray can be found in
README.unix and in chapter 1 of the documentation.

This package contains a statically linked version of POV-Ray 3.7
compiled for the i586 platform.  The install script can do both 
system wide installation (requires root privileges) as well as user
level installation.  Installation as root is the recommended method.

======================
Installation procedure
======================

  a) Install as root

     From the directory where this file resides, run:

       $ su
       # ./install

     and follow the instructions.

  b) Install as non-privileged user

     From the directory where this file resides, run:

       $ ./install

     and select 'U' to start a user level install.  Afterwards
     follow the instructions of the install script.


Additional command line options that can be used are:

  --no-arch-check : skip the architecture compatibility test
  kde       : only install kde panel icons and file types for current 
              user. In a single user installation this is done 
              automatically after installation.
  user      : only update the user povray.ini/povray.conf file when 
              required.
  uninstall : uninstall POV-Ray.  This will remove all installed
              files.  Any changes made to sample scenes or include
              files will get lost.  This has to be called by the 
              same user who installed POV-Ray.  Uninstall of older
              versions of POV-Ray is not supported (and is not 
              required to install this version of POV-Ray).
  test      : run a short test render to check if installation was
              successful.  This should be run as a normal user and
              not as root.
