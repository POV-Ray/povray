Compiling and installing
========================

Basic and detailed instructions to compile and install the generic POV-Ray
source code on UNIX-based systems are given in the INSTALL file.

In a nutshell: the package installation is based on a configure script
which detects your environment automatically and adapts the compilation
and installation process accordingly.  Simply run:

% ./configure COMPILED_BY="your name <email@address>"  # configure the package
% make                                                 # build the program
% su                                                   # log as root
$ make install                                         # install program + data

See the INSTALL file for more detailed information.
