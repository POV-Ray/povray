@brief Source code files containing AVX/FMA4-specific implementations of dynamically dispatched code.

The files in this directory contain code that is intended for dynamic dispatch,
and therefore may need to be compiled with different options than the rest of POV-Ray.
For instance, to compile these files with gcc, the `-mavx -fma4` flags will be needed.
