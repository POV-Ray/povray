<P>The internet home of POV-Ray is reachable on the World Wide Web via the address http://www.povray.org and via ftp as ftp.povray.org. Please stop by often for the latest files, utilities, news and images from the official POV-Ray internet site.</P>
<P>The comp.graphics.rendering.raytracing newsgroup has many competent POV-Ray users that are very willing to share their knowledge. They generally ask that you first browse a few files to see if someone has already answered the same question, and of course, that you follow proper "netiquette". If you have any doubts about the qualifications of the folks that frequent the group, a few minutes spend at the Ray Tracing Competition pages at www.povray.org will quickly convince you!</P>
<P>Also the POV-Team operates its own news server on the internet with several news groups related to POV-Ray and other interesting programs.  For more information about the server see http://www.povray.org/groups.html.</P>
