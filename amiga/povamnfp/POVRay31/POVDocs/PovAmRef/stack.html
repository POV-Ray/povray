<h1>Automatic Stack Extension  --  REMOVED</h1>
<p>
Yes, I removed the automatic stack extension, and opted to fix the stack size
at 100k.  Testing has failed to overflow this stack, and considerable speed has
been gained.  Thanks to Kriton Kyrimis for pointing this out, and I apologize 
for overlooking the speed loss that autostack incurred.
