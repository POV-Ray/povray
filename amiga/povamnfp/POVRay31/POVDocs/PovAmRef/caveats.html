     <b><u>BEWARE!</b></u>

<P>  GUI AREXX support is minimal.  MUI provides some AREXX control, but I haven't
yet set up support for more complex actions, or documentation of the AREXX 
support that MUI already provides.
<P>  The ini and inc lists in the GUI do NOT currently save their contents with the default settings.
This is extremely annoying, I know.  The problem is caused by some odd behavior of MUI, and I've not yet been able
to properly work around it.
<P>  The GUI launches POV-Ray with the GUI's own directory as it's current directory,
so you must explicity list the scenefile directory in 'Includes' if there are any files there
that your scenefile #includes.  This should change shortly.
