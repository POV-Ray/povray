<H3>What the hell is '<B>Cuttlefish</B>??</H3>
<BR>
<P>Cutlefish is the name of a project I am working on right now to
create a powerful materials editor for Amiga POV-Ray users.  The GUI
(using MUI) is 75% completed, and the underlying data handling code 
is about 30% complete.  At this time, I expect the project to be
completed late in the winter, probably March.
<p>Using dynamically created windows with MUI, and lots of custom
floating point gadgets, I have been able to create a GUI that allows
you to explore much of the power of the POV-Ray materials.  At the top 
level, a material can be a 'simple' texture, or use any of the mapping
capabilities of POV-Ray (images, patterns, average, layers) to allow
multiple textures.  Each 'child' texture can be opened and edited 
independantly, and loaded and saved as an independant #include file.
<P>
At the next level down, Pigment and Normal function in the same fashion,
allowing multiple children, each of which can have multiple children, etc
ad nauseum.  Given enough memory (both system and display) the number of
simultaneous editing windows is unlimited.
<P>
multiple sequential transformations can be applied to any portion
of a material, just as POV-Ray allows.  Double-clicking on a component
in a pattern list (ie, gradient) opens a new window to allow editing of that component, 
be it a simple pigment or a complete texture.
<P>
Why 'Cuttlefish'?  Well, if you've ever seen one, you know.  If not, 
you should try to.  They can not only change colors (extremely rapidly),
they can adapt to a variety of patterns, apparently communicating through
color patterns on their skin, and can actually change the physical
texture of their skin at will to help simulate their surroundings.  They put
chameleons to shame.  I am tired of everything in the computer world having
such descriptive, formal, boring names.  To paraphrase the author of the
Amiga Email client 'Eucalyptus', I just like the name, and it rolls so nicely 
off the tongue.
