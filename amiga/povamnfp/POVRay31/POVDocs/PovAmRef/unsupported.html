<h1>Unsupported Features</h1>
<ul>
<li>     I opted not to support &quot;start_clock&quot; and &quot;end_clock&quot; from the GUI,
since their usage is discouraged ayway.  The &quot;Clock&quot; gadgets sets a
single frame's clock value.

<li>     &quot;All_Streams&quot; options are missing from the GUI.

<li>     CPU Utilization Histogram is unsupported, since I couldn't devise
a simple way to get meaningful data.

<li>     Also regarding time: Elapsed time is used to determine time needed
to render, so if you pause and restart, the time paused adds in too.
