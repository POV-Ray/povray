<P>Vendors wishing to bundle POV-Ray with commercial software (including shareware) or other distribution not already described above must first obtain explicit permission from the POV-Team. Such permission is rarely granted. The POV-Team will decide if such distribution will be allowed on a case-by-case basis and may impose certain restrictions as it sees fit. The minimum terms are given below. Other conditions may be imposed. </P>
<P>The product must be an existing product that has proven itself as commercially viable without POV-Ray included.    The inclusion of POV-Ray should be promoted only as a free bonus and not as a feature designed to encourage customers to purchase or upgrade solely for the POV-Ray capability.    Purchasers of your product must not be led to believe that they are paying for POV-Ray. Any mention of the POV-Ray bundle on the box, in advertising or in instruction manuals must be clearly marked with a disclaimer that POV-Ray is free software and can be obtained for free or nominal cost from various sources.    Include clear and obvious information on how to obtain the official POV-Ray.    You must provide all POV-Ray support for all users who acquired POV- Ray through your product. The POV-Team is not obligated to provide you or your customers any technical support.    Include a credit page or pages in your documentation for POV-Ray.    If you modify any portion POV-Ray for use with your hardware or software, you must follow the custom version rules in addition to these rules.    Include contact and support information for your product.    Include a full user package as described above. </P>
