<P>Unfortunately all English language books on POV-Ray are out of print and there are no plans to reprint them.  However there is now a POV-Ray 3.02 book and CD-ROM available in Japanese.  It talks about the Windows and Mac versions of POV-Ray, and various utilities.  The CD-ROM is dual format, Windows/Mac. It was written in Japan by Hideki Komuro-san, and published by ASCII Corp. in June 1998, ISBN 4-7561-1831-3.</P>
<P>Many popular computer magazines have been authorized to distribute POV-Ray on cover CDs.  Note that such distributions of the official version of POV-Ray is permitted under the terms of the General License in the file POVLEGAL.DOC.  The POV-Team does not endorse the distributor or its products.  The POV-Team receives no compensation for this distribution.</P>
