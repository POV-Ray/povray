<P>On-line services, BBS's and internet sites may distribute the POV-Ray software under the conditions in this section. Sites which allow users to run POV-Ray from remote locations must use separate provisions in the section below. </P>
<P>The archives must all be easily available on the service and should be grouped together in a similar on-line area. </P>
<P>It is strongly requested that sites remove prior versions of POV-Ray to avoid user confusion and simplify or minimize our support efforts. </P>
<P>The site may only charge standard usage rates for the downloading of this software. A premium may not be charged for this package. I.E. CompuServe or America On-Line may make these archives available to their users, but they may only charge regular usage rates for the time required to download. </P>
