<P>Some internet sites have been set up so that remote users can actually run POV-Ray software on the internet server. Other companies sell CPU time for running POV-Ray software on workstations or high-speed computers. Such use of POV-Ray software is permitted under the following conditions. </P>
<P>Fees or charges, if any, for such services must be for connect time, storage or processor usage ONLY. No premium charges may be assessed for use of POV-Ray beyond that charged for use of other software. Users must be clearly notified that they are being charged for use of the computer and not for use of POV-Ray software. </P>
<P>Users must be prominently informed that they are using POV-Ray software, that such software is free, and where they can find official POV-Ray software. Any attempt to obscure the fact that the user is running POV-Ray is expressly prohibited. </P>
<P>All files normally available in a full package distribution, especially a copy of this license and full documentation must be available for download or readable online so that users of an online executable have access to all of the material of a full user package. </P>
<P>If the POV-Ray software has been modified in any way, it must also follow the provisions for custom versions below. </P>
