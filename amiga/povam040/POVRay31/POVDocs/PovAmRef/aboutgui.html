<h1>About the POV-Ray GUI</h1>
<P>     
     The 'official' POV-Ray 3.x GUI requires <a href="mui.html">MUI</a> 3.x in
order to run.  POV-Ray itself <i>does not.</i>
<P>     I'm not entirely satisfied with the GUI as it stands.  It being my 
first MUI application, it took entirely too long to write, and has too 
many kludges and 'quick-fixes' in it.  (<a href="future.html">see Future plans</a>)
<P>     I plan to release corrections and updates of the GUI independantly of 
the main POV-Ray distribution, which will also contain the latest stable 
version of the GUI.  Look for &quot;POV3GUI.LHA&quot; at the same location as the 
full Amiga POV-Ray release:  if it is newer than the latest full release 
version it will be noted there.
<P>
     Officially, Amiga POV-Ray is currently sync'ed with the full generic 
POV-Ray sources, version 3.1a.  The Amiga GUI is numbered seperately, since
it is actually an independant application.  The current release is 3.00.
<P>
     The latest versions (GUI V3 and POV-Ray V3.1) are NOT compatible with
earlier versions.  If you are going to use POV-Ray V3.02, you cannot use GUI V3.
Sorry, but the messaging system had to be changed to stabilize the communications
and clean up the process.
