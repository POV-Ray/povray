<h1>Installation of POV-Ray Amiga</h1>
<p>
If installed with the supplied Installer script, all files are placed
properly, and the GUI and POVDocs directory can be placed anywhere
on the system: the script will create the necessary ENV variables to
link things together.  Installer places these in an ENV directory
called &quot;POV31&quot;, but POV-Ray will find them in the main ENV: directory
if this subdir doesn't exist.
