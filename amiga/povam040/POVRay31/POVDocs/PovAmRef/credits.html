Very special thanks to my wife Trisha for tolerating the long late-night
hours I put in making this all come together, and to my
3 year old son Donald for all his assistance at the keyboard.<img src="smiley.gif" width=17 height=17>
<P>
The Amiga version of POV-Ray is dedicated to Jay Miner, who
encouraged me several years ago to push the Amiga's graphical limits, and 
to Rich Ragosa, who gave me his copy of Kernighan/Ritchie's "The C Programming Language" 
several years ago.  You are both missed.
