<h1>Output File Formats</h1>
<p>
The POV-Team has dropped support of 'dump' output file format, which
many Amiga users used (AKA QRT) and now supports PNG (Portable Network
Graphics) format, capable of 5 to 16 bits per color, plus optional
alpha channel, for up to 64 BPP, with exceptional compression.  JPEG
was considered, and was passed over due to it's 'lossy' nature.  I
thought long and hard about an Amiga-specific format support, using
IFF-24, but decided against it. (among other reasons, the program is
already too damn big)  There is support available for Amiga PNG, including
datatype and format converters, or you can use RLE Targa Compresssed.
