<h1>GUI-only Features</h1>

<P> The bottom portion of the main GUI window is where the message streams from
POV-Ray are displayed as it works.  If you resize the GUI too small, the streams
are hidden.  Resize larger again, and the streams display is restored.  You can 
scroll up and down through the messages, even from prior renders.  Press the
vertical "clear' button on the left to clear the messages.
<P>
     When rendering, you can select &quot;Hide Main&quot; on the render status
window to close the main GUI window.
<P>
     &quot;Pause&quot; will pause a render mid-stream, then continue without restarting
POV-Ray.  Useful if you desperately need CPU time elsewhere. &quot;Stop Render&quot; also
works while paused.
<P>
     &quot;Render&quot;, when a project is already rendering, will open the RenderQueue
window, building a list of projects to render in sequence.  This window allows
you to reorder the list of projects, delete from the list, and stop the current
render in progrss.
<P>
     'park' the mouse cursor over any gadget for MUI's ShortHelp bubbles.  The HELP
key facility of MUI to call up AmigaGuide documents, is not available since the
documentation is in HTML format.

<P>
     Save Default/Load Default menus save or load all settings using MUI's
MUIM_Application_Load/Save feature, storing them in MUI's ENV directory. These
settings are loaded automatically on startup.
<P>
     Save menu calls a file requester and saves current settings as a standard .INI file.
<P>
     Load menu option, to load an .ini file into the GUI, is still not supported.
(complain if you want, I've been kind of busy.  8^)
