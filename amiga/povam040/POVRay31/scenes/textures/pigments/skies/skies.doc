This file contains some predefined skies for you to use in your scenes.
There are several different types, each type identified by a mnemonic
prefix.  All pigment definitions start with "P_", all sky_spheres start
with "S_", all textures start with "T_", and all objects start with
"O_".


    Pigments:    (building blocks for the stuff below)
    ========
    P_Cloud1
    P_Cloud2
    P_Cloud3

    SkySpheres:

    S_Cloud1     sky_sphere, uses P_Cloud2.
    S_Cloud2     sky_sphere  uses P_Cloud2.
    S_Cloud3     sky_sphere  uses P_Cloud3.
    S_Cloud4     sky_sphere  uses P_Cloud3.
    S_Cloud5     sky_sphere.

    Textures:
