This file simply includes both STONES1.INC and STONES2.INC.  Use it if
you need access to textures from both files.  For faster parsing and
reduced memory requirments, if you don't need both files, then you
should include only the one that you need.

This file contains a set of rich stone textures that were designed for
us by Mike Miller, using modified texture names.  The original texture
names have all had a "T_" prepended to them.


                               STONES2.INC


There are 20 stone textures defined in the file, STONES2.INC.
Most are at least two layers, and all use turbulence on each
layer, so they will be a bit slow to render.

Also included are BENIDITI.POV, MARBTEAL.POV, PINKMARB.POV, and
RDGRANIT.POV.  These textures have been kept separate from the
STONES2.INC file because they use 256 entry color_maps that would slow
parsing when not needed.  The color maps for these textures were
extracted from actual scanned images as described in WOODS.DOC.
