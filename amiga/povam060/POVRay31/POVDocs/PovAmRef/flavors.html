<h1>Flavors of POV-Ray Amiga</h1>
<UL bulletted>
<li>     680x0 NoFPU
<LI>     68020 &amp; up with FPU
<LI>     68040 &amp; up
<LI>     68060
<LI>     PowerPC (testing now - Watch the <A HREF="http://www.amigaworld.com/support/povamiga">POVAmiga Home Page</A>)
</UL>          
<p>     I run on an '030 system, and clocked no appreciable difference with 
'020 or '030 optimized versions. 
<p>     PowerPC version is in development now thanks to Luke Marshall.  We have a working
ELF binary, but it is still just the generic POV-Ray, without Amiga-specific support.
We are working on incorporating most of the Amiga-specific code that was developed for the
68K versions, including Datatype loading, Cybergraphics display, and faster memory code.
We are likely NOT going to have GUI support at first.
<P>
As a quick comparison (based on our first working, unoptimized compile)
one test scene that renders in 58 minutes on a 40MHz 030/882 system takes 37 seconds on a 200MHz PPC604.
<P>
Support for other "future Amigas" is planned as well, including updates to take advantage of any useful new features in OS3.5, 
and full support for OS5 systems once they are available.
