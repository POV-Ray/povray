<h1>Miscellaneous Notes and Information</H1>
<P>
     When running POV-Ray 'by hand' in a shell window, ctrl-C <B>will</B> now
break the task. However, the following commandline 'inherits' the ctrl-c character,
so whatever command is typed next will be unrecognized.  Anyone knowing how to
fix this PLEASE contact Joel NewKirk.  (fflush(stdin) doesn't do it...)
<P>
     I'm currently making improvements to Amiga POV-Ray, including new
display modules.  If possible, these will be released in a revision
sync'ed to a general POV-Ray revision.  If necessary, however, there will
be an Amiga-only revision to address needed changes.  Don't count on
Amiga and General releases necessarily occuring together.
<P>
     I am expecting to be the Amiga POV-Ray representative for the 
forseeable future.  Eventually, I hope to get a domain name assigned
for the POVAmiga web site.  In the nearer future, work is in progress
to get an 'unofficial' POV-Amiga mailing list going.
<P>
     There are many POV-Ray related utilities available, mostly for other
systems.  Several of these utilities have been or are being ported to
Amiga by myself and others.  Work is also being done on a <A HREF="Cuttlefish.html">Materials Editor</a>,
and possibly a modeller.  The design of the Amiga POV-Ray GUI communication
is such that it allows easy replacement of the official GUI with another,
so it is quite likely that other GUI's (likely a non-MUI version) will 
become available, as well as direct interface to a modeller.
<P>
     The Official POV-Ray Amiga release is NO LONGER COMPATIBLE with earlier
     GUI releases, due to changes in the message handling.  Sorry.
