<h1>POV-Ray documentation</h1>
<P>
The Amiga distribution of POV-Ray comes with the POV-Ray documentation in 
HTML format.  PostScript, PlainText, and PDF versions can be reached on the POV-
Ray Web site, <a href="http://www.povray.org">http://www.povray.org.</a>
<P>
Previous releases of POV-Ray on Amiga included Amigaguide documentation.
Unfortunately, this is no longer a reasonable option for us, with the
standard documentation now being primarily HTML and PDF.
<P>Also, previous releases included scenefiles for the example images in
the documentation.  V3.1 no longer provides this, and therefore the images
are always included in the distribution.  This makes for a larger archive,
but assures that you have illustrations AND sample pics available for the tutorials and such,
without having to already know POV-Ray to be able to render them yourself.
