<P>The headquarters of POV-Ray are on CompuServe in the POVRAY forum, that is managed by some of the team members. We meet there to share information, useful programs and utilities and graphics created by POV-Ray. Members of our CompuServe Forum also get early access to beta versions and first hand support from POV-Team members. Everyone is welcome to join in on the action on CIS:POVRAY. Hope to see you there! You can get information on joining CompuServe by calling (800)848-8990 or visit the CompuServe home page http://www.compuserve.com. Direct CompuServe access is also available in Japan, Europe and many other countries. </P>
