<H3><A NAME="_Toc429993772">Conditions For Distribution Of Custom Versions</A> </H3>
<P>If your re-compiled version meets all requirements for custom versions listed above, the following conditions apply to its distribution: </P>
<P>You must provide all POV-Ray support for all users who use your custom version. You must provide information so that user may contact you for support for your custom version. The POV-Ray Team is not obligated to provide you or your users any technical support. </P>
<P>Include contact information in the DISTRIBUTION_MESSAGE macros in the source file OPTOUT.H and insure that the program prominently displays this information. Display all copyright notices and credit screens for the official version. </P>
<P>Custom versions may only be distributed as freeware. You must make all of your modifications to POV-Ray freely and publicly available with FULL SOURCE CODE to the modified portions of POV-Ray and must freely distribute full source to any new parts of the custom version. The goal is that users must be able to re-compile the program themselves using readily available compilers and run-time libraries and to be able to further improve the program with their own modifications. </P>
<P>You must provide documentation for any and all modifications that you have made to the program that you are distributing. Include clear and obvious information on how to obtain the official POV-Ray. </P>
<P>The user is encouraged to send enhancements and bug fixes to the POV-Ray Team, but the team is in no way required to utilize these enhancements or fixes. By sending material to the team, the contributor asserts that he owns the materials or has the right to distribute these materials. He authorizes the team to use the materials any way they like. The contributor still retains rights to the donated material, but by donating, grants unrestricted, irrevocable usage and distribution rights to the POV- Team. The team doesn't have to use the material, but if we do, you do not acquire any rights related to POV-Ray. The team will give you credit as the creator of new code if applicable. </P>
<P>Include a copy of this document (POVLEGAL.DOC). </P>
