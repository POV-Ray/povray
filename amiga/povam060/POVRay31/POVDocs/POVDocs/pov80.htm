<P>In the glass example above, we noticed that there were bright little <I>hotspots </I>on the surface. This gave the sphere a hard, shiny appearance. POV-Ray gives us two ways to specify surface specular highlights. The first is called <I>Phong highlighting. </I>Usually, Phong highlights are described using two keywords: <b><code>phong</code></b> and <b><code>phong_size</code></b>. The float that follows <b><code>phong</code></b> determines the brightness of the highlight while the float following <b><code>phong_size</code></b> determines its size. Let's try this.</P>
<PRE>  sphere { &lt;0,0,0&gt;, 1
    pigment { Gray50 }
    finish {
      ambient .2
      diffuse .6
      phong .75
      phong_size 25
    }
  }</PRE>
<P>Rendering this we see a fairly broad, soft highlight that gives the sphere a kind of plastic appearance. Now let's change <b><code>phong_size</code></b> to 150. This makes a much smaller highlight which gives the sphere the appearance of being much harder and shinier.</P>
<P>There is another kind of highlight that is calculated by a different means called <I>specular highlighting</I>. It is specified using the keyword <b><code>specular</code></b> and operates in conjunction with another keyword called <b><code>roughness</code></b>. These two keywords work together in much the same way as <b><code>phong</code></b> and <b><code>phong_size</code></b> to create highlights that alter the apparent shininess of the surface. Let's try using specular in our sphere.</P>
<PRE>  sphere { &lt;0,0,0&gt;, 1
     pigment { Gray50 }
     finish {
        ambient .2
        diffuse .6
        specular .75
        roughness .1
    }
  }</PRE>
<P>Looking at the result we see a broad, soft highlight similar to what we had when we used <b><code>phong_size</code></b> of 25. Change <b><code>roughness</code></b> to .001 and render again. Now we see a small, tight highlight similar to what we had when we used <b><code>phong_size</code></b> of 150. Generally speaking, specular is slightly more accurate and therefore slightly more realistic than phong but you should try both methods when designing a texture. There are even times when both phong and specular may be used on a finish.</P>
