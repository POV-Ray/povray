<P>This document details the use of the Persistence of Vision &trade; Ray-Tracer (POV-Ray &trade;). It is divided into five parts:</P>
<DIR>

<dir>
1)&#9;This introduction which explains what POV-Ray is and what ray-tracing is. It gives a brief overview of how to create ray-traced images.</P>
<P>2)&#9;A "<A HREF="pov13.htm#_Ref413502638">Beginning Tutorial</A>" which explains step by step how to use the different features of POV-Ray.</P>
<P>3)&#9;A complete reference on "<A HREF="pov156.htm#_Ref413502655">Scene Description Language</A>" in which you describe the scene.</P>
<P>4)&#9;A complete reference on "<A HREF="pov120.htm#_Ref413502672">POV-Ray Options</A>" which explains options (set either by command line switches or by INI file keywords) that tell POV-Ray how to render the scenes.</P>
<P>5)&#9;And in our "<A HREF="pov389.htm#_Ref413502693">APPENDICES</A>" you will find some tips and hints, where to get the latest version and versions for other platforms, information on compiling custom versions of POV-Ray, suggested reading, contact addresses and legal information.</P>

</dir>

</dir>
<P>POV-Ray runs on MS-Dos, Windows 3.x, Windows for Workgroups 3.11, Windows 95, Windows NT, Apple Macintosh 68k, Macintosh Power PC, Amiga, Linux, Sun-OS, UNIX and other platforms.</P>
<P>We assume that if you are reading this document then you already have POV-Ray installed and running.  However the POV-Team does distribute this file by itself in various formats including online on the internet.  If you don't have POV-Ray or aren't sure you have the official version or the latest version, see appendix "<A HREF="pov409.htm#_Ref411499510">What to do if you don't have POV-Ray</A>".</P>
<P>This document covers only the generic parts of the program which are common to each version.  <B>Each version has platform-specific documentation not included here.</B>  We recommend you finish reading this introductory section then read the platform-specific information before trying the tutorial here.</P>
<P>The platform-specific docs will show you how to render a sample scene and will give you detailed description of the platform-specific features.</P>
<P>The MS-Dos version documentation contains a plain text file <CODE>POVMSDOS.DOC</CODE> which contains its specific docs.  It can be found in the main directory where you installed POV-Ray such as <CODE>C:\POVRAY3</CODE>.</P>
<P>The Windows version documentation is available on the POV-Ray program's Help menu or press the F1 key while in the program.</P>
<P>The Mac platform documentation consists of a self-displaying document called "<CODE>POV-Ray MacOS Read Me</CODE>" which contains information specific to the Mac version of POV-Ray. It is best to read this document first, to learn how to set up and start using the Mac version of POV-Ray. This document is in the "<CODE>Documentation</CODE>" folder in the main "<CODE>POV-Ray 3</CODE>" folder.</P>
<P>The Amiga version documentation is made up of Html documents, stored in the same place of general POV-Ray docs; the 'root' document is "POVRAY3:POV-Reference/AmigaPOV.html" when the program is installed following the instruction given.  Amiga specific documentation and POV-Ray general docs are available pressing Help key in the POV-Gui program; this feature is available in POV-Gui since version 2.1</P>
<P>The Linux version documentation contains a plain text file <CODE>povlinux.doc</CODE> which contains its specific docs.  It can be found in the main directory where you installed POV-Ray such as <CODE>/usr/povray3</CODE>.</P>
<P>The SunOS version documentation contains a plain text file <CODE>povsunos.doc</CODE> which contains its specific docs.  It can be found in the main directory where you installed POV-Ray such as <CODE>/usr/povray3</CODE>.</P>
<P>The generic Unix version documentation contains a plain text file <CODE>povunix.doc</CODE> which contains its specific docs.  It can be found in the main directory where you installed POV-Ray such as <CODE>/usr/povray3</CODE>.</P>
