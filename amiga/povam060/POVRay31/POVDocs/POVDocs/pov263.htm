<P ALIGN="CENTER">The union of two objects.</P>
</B><P>The simplest kind of CSG is the <b><code>union</code></b>. The syntax is:</P>
<I><DL>
<DT>UNION:</DT>
</I><b><code><DD>union {</code></b> <I>OBJECTS...  [OBJECT_MODIFIERS...]</I> <b><code>}</DD>
</DL>
</code></b><P>Unions are simply glue used to bind two or more shapes into a single entity that can be manipulated as a single object. The image above shows the union of <b><code>A</code></b> and <b><code>B</code></b>. The new object created by the union operation can be scaled, translated and rotated as a single shape. The entire union can share a single texture but each object contained in the union may also have its own texture, which will override any texture statements in the parent object.</P>
<P>You should be aware that the surfaces inside the union will not be removed. As you can see from the figure this may be a problem for transparent unions. If you want those surfaces to be removed you'll have to use the <b><code>merge</code></b> operations explained in a later section.</P>
<P>The following union will contain a box and a sphere.</P>
<PRE>  union {
    box { &lt;-1.5, -1, -1&gt;, &lt;0.5, 1, 1&gt; }
    cylinder { &lt;0.5, 0, -1&gt;, &lt;0.5, 0, 1&gt;, 1 }
  }</PRE>
<P>Earlier versions of POV-Ray placed restrictions on unions so you often had to combine objects with <b><code>composite</code></b> statements.  Those earlier restrictions have been lifted so <b><code>composite</code></b> is no longer needed. It is still supported for backwards compatibility.</P>
