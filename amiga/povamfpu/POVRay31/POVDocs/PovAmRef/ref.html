<h1>Reference Guide Illustrations</h1>

There is a directory called "DocDemos" in the POV-Reference directory.
It contains the scenefiles used to create the example illustrations that
are part of the documentation.  The Images are on the IPISA CD-ROM along
with the HTML documentation, but you can re-render them if you wish, or
simply examine the files to see how a particular effect was achieved.
