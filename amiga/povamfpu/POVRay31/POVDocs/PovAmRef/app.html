<h1>GUI is Appwindow (&amp; Appicon)</h1>

     POV-Ray GUI main window is an AppWindow: drop .pov, .ini, or .inc
files onto it on the workbench screen and it incorporates them correctly.
Drop a directory or disk icon and it is incorporated as a searchpath for
.inc's.  When iconified, it is a functioning AppIcon, so the same actions 
are possible.
