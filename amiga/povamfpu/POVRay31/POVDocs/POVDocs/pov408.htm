<P>The POV-Team is a collection of volunteer programmers, designers, animators and artists meeting via electronic mail on CompuServe's POVRAY forum (GO POVRAY). The POV-Team's goal is to create freely distributable, high quality rendering and animation software written in C that can be easily ported to many different computers.</P>
