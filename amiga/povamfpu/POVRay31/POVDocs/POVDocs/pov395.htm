<H3><A NAME="_Toc429993768">Conditions For Shareware/Freeware Distribution Companies</A> </H3>
<P>Shareware and freeware distribution companies may distribute the software included in software-only compilations using media such as, but not limited to, floppy disk, CD-ROM, tape backup, optical disks, hard disks, or memory cards. This section only applies to distributors of collected programs. Anyone wishing to bundle the package with a shareware product must use the commercial bundling rules. </P>
<P>For floppy disk distribution, no more than five dollars U.S. ($5) can be charged per disk for the copying of this software and the media it is provided on. Space on each disk must be used as fully as possible. You may not spread the files over more disks than are necessary. </P>
<P>Distribution on high capacity media such as backup tape or CD-ROM is permitted if the total cost to the user is no more than $0.08 U.S. dollars per megabyte of data. For example a CD-ROM with 600 meg could cost no more than $48.00 US. Any bundling with books, magazines or other print media is permitted if the total cost of the book or magazine with CD is less than the $48.00 limit. Bundling with more expensive publications or distributions should also use the commercial rules. </P>
