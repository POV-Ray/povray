             GENERAL LICENSE AGREEMENT -- POVLEGAL.DOC
                                 
THIS NOTICE MUST ACCOMPANY ALL OFFICIAL OR CUSTOM PERSISTENCE OF
VISION FILES. IT MAY NOT BE REMOVED OR MODIFIED. THIS INFORMATION
PERTAINS TO ALL USE OF THE PACKAGE WORLDWIDE.  THIS DOCUMENT
SUPERSEDES ALL PREVIOUS GENERAL LICENSES OR DISTRIBUTION POLICIES.
ANY INDIVIDUALS, COMPANIES OR GROUPS WHO HAVE BEEN GRANTED SPECIAL
LICENSES MAY CONTINUE TO DISTRIBUTE VERSION 2.x BUT MUST RE-APPLY
FOR VERSION 3.00 OR LATER.

This document pertains to the use and distribution of the
Persistence of Vision(tm) Ray Tracer a.k.a POV-Ray(tm). It applies
to all POV-Ray program source files, executable (binary) files,
scene files, documentation files, help file, bitmaps and INI files
contained in official POV-Ray Team(tm) archives.  All of these are
referred to here as "the software". The POV-Team reserves the
right to revise these rules in future versions and to make
additional rules to address new circumstances at any time.

All of this software is Copyright 1991,1999 by the POV-Ray
Team(tm). Although it is distributed as freeware, it is NOT PUBLIC
DOMAIN.

The copyrighted package may ONLY be distributed and/or modified
according to the license granted herein.  The spirit of the
license is to promote POV-Ray as a standard ray tracer, provide
the full POV-Ray package freely to as many users as possible,
prevent POV-Ray users and developers from being taken advantage
of, enhance the life quality of those who come in contact with POV-
Ray.  This license was created so these goals could be realized.
You are legally bound to follow these rules, but we hope you will
follow them as a matter of ethics, rather than fear of litigation.

                         USAGE PROVISIONS
                                 
Permission is granted to the user to use the software and
associated files in this package to create and render images. The
use of this software for the purpose of creating images is
completely free. The creator of a scene file and the image created
from the scene file, retains all rights to the image and scene
file they created and may use them for any purpose commercial or
non-commercial.

The user is also granted the right to use the scenes files, fonts,
bitmaps, and include files distributed in the INCLUDE and
SCENES\INCDEMO sub-directories in their own scenes.  Such
permission does not extend to files in the SCENES directory or its
sub-directories.  The SCENES files are for your enjoyment and
education but may not be the basis of any derivative works.

                GENERAL RULES FOR ALL DISTRIBUTION
                                 
The permission to distribute this package under certain very
specific conditions is granted in advance, provided that the
following conditions are met.

These archives must not be re-archived using a different method
without the explicit permission of the POV-Team.  You may rename
the archives only to meet the file name conventions of your system
or to avoid file name duplications but we ask that you try to keep
file names as similar to the originals as possible.  (For example:
POVSRC.ZIP to POVSRC30.ZIP)

Ready-to-run unarchived distribution on CD-ROM is also permitted
if the files are arranged in our standard directory or folder
structure as though it had been properly installed on a hard disk.

You must distribute a FULL PACKAGE of files as described in the
next section.  No portion of this package may be separated from
the package and distributed separately other than under the
conditions specified in the provisions given below.

Non-commercial distribution in which no money or compensation is
charged (such as a user copying the software for a personal friend
or colleague) is permitted with no other restrictions.

Teachers and educational institutions may also distribute the
material to students for free or they may charge minimal copying
costs if the software is to be used in a course.

                   DEFINITION OF "FULL PACKAGE"
                                 
A "full package" contains an executable program, documentation,
and sample scenes.  For generic Unix platforms, there are no
executables available so the portable C source code must be
included instead of the executable program.

POV-Ray is officially distributed for MS-Dos; Windows 95/98/NT;
Linux for Intel x86 series; Apple Macintosh; Apple PowerPC; SunOS;
and Amiga. Other systems may be added in the future.

Distributors need not support all platforms but for each platform
you support you must distribute a full package. For example a
Macintosh only CD-ROM need not distribute the Windows versions.

This software may ONLY be bundled with other software packages
according to the conditions specified in the provisions below.

   CONDITIONS FOR CD-ROM OR SHAREWARE/FREEWARE DISTRIBUTION 
                                 
Shareware and freeware distribution companies may distribute the
software included in software-only compilations using media such
as, but not limited to, floppy disk, CD-ROM, tape backup, optical
disks, hard disks, or memory cards. This section only applies to
distributors of collected programs. Anyone wishing to bundle the
package with a shareware product must use the commercial bundling
rules.

Distribution on CD-ROM or high capacity media such as backup tape 
is permitted if the total cost to the user is no more than $0.08
U.S. dollars per megabyte of data. For example a CD-ROM with 600
meg could cost no more than $48.00 US. 

Any bundling with books,magazines or other print media is 
permitted if the total cost of the book or magazine with CD is 
less than the $48.00 limit.  Bundling with more expensive 
publications or distributions should use the commercial rules.

For floppy disk distribution, no more than five dollars U.S. ($5)
can be charged per disk for the copying of this software and the
media it is provided on. Space on each disk must be used as fully
as possible. You may not spread the files over more disks than are
necessary.

   CONDITIONS FOR ON-LINE SERVICES AND BBS'S INCLUDING INTERNET
                                 
On-line services, BBS's and internet sites may distribute the POV-
Ray software under the conditions in this section. Sites which
allow users to run POV-Ray from remote locations must use separate
provisions in the section below.

The archives must all be easily available on the service and
should be grouped together in a similar on-line area.

It is strongly requested that sites remove prior versions of POV-
Ray to avoid user confusion and simplify or minimize our support
efforts.

The site may only charge standard usage rates for the downloading
of this software. A premium may not be charged for this package.
I.E. CompuServe or America On-Line may make these archives
available to their users, but they may only charge regular usage
rates for the time required to download.

               ONLINE OR REMOTE EXECUTION OF POV-Ray
                                 
Some internet sites have been set up so that remote users can
actually run POV-Ray software on the internet server. Other
companies sell CPU time for running POV-Ray software on
workstations or high-speed computers. Such use of POV-Ray software
is permitted under the following conditions.

Fees or charges, if any, for such services must be for connect
time, storage or processor usage ONLY. No premium charges may be
assessed for use of POV-Ray beyond that charged for use of other
software. Users must be clearly notified that they are being
charged for use of the computer and not for use of POV-Ray
software.

Users must be prominently informed that they are using POV-Ray
software, that such software is free, and where they can find
official POV-Ray software. Any attempt to obscure the fact that
the user is running POV-Ray is expressly prohibited.

All files normally available in a full package distribution,
especially a copy of this license and full documentation must be
available for download or readable online so that users of an
online executable have access to all of the material of a full
user package.

If the POV-Ray software has been modified in any way, it must also
follow the provisions for custom versions below.

            PERMITTED MODIFICATION AND CUSTOM VERSIONS
                                 
Although the full source code for POV-Ray is distributed, there
are strict rules for the use of the source code. The source
distribution is provided to;  1) promote the porting of POV-Ray to
hardware and operating systems which the POV-Team cannot support.
2) promote experimentation and development of new features to the
core code which might eventually be incorporated into the official
version.  3) provide insight into the inner workings of the
program for educational purposes.

These license provisions have been established to promote the
growth of POV-Ray and prevent difficulties for users and
developers alike. Please follow them carefully for the benefit of
all concerned when creating a custom version.

The user is granted the privilege to modify and compile the source
code for their own personal use in any fashion they see fit. What
you do with the software in your own home is your business.

However severe restrictions are imposed if the user wishes to
distribute a modified version of the software, documentation or
other parts of the package (here after referred to as a "custom
version"). You must follow the provisions given below. This
includes any translation of the documentation into other languages
or other file formats.

A "custom version" is defined as a fully functional version of POV-
Ray with all existing features intact. ANY OTHER USE OF ANY POV-
Ray SOURCE CODE IS EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED. The POV-Team does not
license source code for any use outside POV-Ray. No portion of the
POV-Ray source code may be incorporated into another program
unless it is clearly a custom version of POV-Ray that includes all
of the basic functions of POV-Ray.

All executables, documentation, modified files and descriptions of
the same must clearly identify themselves as a modified and
unofficial version of POV-Ray. Any attempt to obscure the fact
that the user is running POV-Ray or to obscure that this is an
unofficial version expressly prohibited.

POV-Ray may not be linked into other software either at compile-
time using an object code linker nor at run-time as a DLL,
ActiveX, or other system. Such linkage can tend to blur the end-
user's perception of which program provides which functions and
thus qualifies as an attempt to obscure what is running.

To allow POV-Ray to communicate with outside programs, the official
versions of POV-Ray include several internal communication "hooks" 
for it to call other tasks, often called an Application Programming 
Interface, or API. For example: the generic part of POV-Ray provides
operating system shell-out API commands. The Windows version has a 
GUI-extension API and the ability to replace the text editor.
Modification to these APIs or other officially supported
communication mechanisms to increase functionality beyond that of 
the official version IS EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED.

          CONDITIONS FOR DISTRIBUTION OF CUSTOM VERSIONS
                                 
If your re-compiled version meets all requirements for custom
versions listed above, the following conditions apply to its
distribution:

You must provide all POV-Ray support for all users who use your
custom version. You must provide information so that user may
contact you for support for your custom version. The POV-Ray Team
is not obligated to provide you or your users any technical
support.

Include contact information in the DISTRIBUTION_MESSAGE macros in
the source file OPTOUT.H and insure that the program prominently
displays this information. Display all copyright notices and
credit screens for the official version.

Custom versions may only be distributed as freeware. You must make
all of your modifications to POV-Ray freely and publicly available
with FULL SOURCE CODE to the modified portions of POV-Ray and must
freely distribute full source to any new parts of the custom
version. The goal is that users must be able to re-compile the
program themselves using readily available compilers and run-time
libraries and to be able to further improve the program with their
own modifications.

You must provide documentation for any and all modifications that
you have made to the program that you are distributing. Include
clear and obvious information on how to obtain the official POV-
Ray.

The user is encouraged to send enhancements and bug fixes to the
POV-Ray Team, but the team is in no way required to utilize these
enhancements or fixes. By sending material to the team, the
contributor asserts that he owns the materials or has the right to
distribute these materials. He authorizes the team to use the
materials any way they like. The contributor still retains rights
to the donated material, but by donating, grants unrestricted,
irrevocable usage and distribution rights to the POV- Team. The
team doesn't have to use the material, but if we do, you do not
acquire any rights related to POV-Ray. The team will give you
credit as the creator of new code if applicable.

Include a copy of this document (POVLEGAL.DOC).

                CONDITIONS FOR COMMERCIAL BUNDLING
                                 
Vendors wishing to bundle POV-Ray with commercial software
(including shareware) or other distribution not already described
above must first obtain explicit permission from the POV-Team.
Such permission is rarely granted. The POV-Team will decide if
such distribution will be allowed on a case-by-case basis and may
impose certain restrictions as it sees fit. The minimum terms are
given below. Other conditions may be imposed.

    The product must be an existing product that has proven itself 
as commercially viable without POV-Ray included.

    The inclusion of POV-Ray should be promoted only as a free
bonus and not as a feature designed to encourage customers to
purchase or upgrade solely for the POV-Ray capability.

    Purchasers of your product must not be led to believe that
they are paying for POV-Ray. Any mention of the POV-Ray bundle on
the box, in advertising or in instruction manuals must be clearly
marked with a disclaimer that POV-Ray is free software and can be
obtained for free or nominal cost from various sources.

    Include clear and obvious information on how to obtain the
official POV-Ray.

    You must provide all POV-Ray support for all users who
acquired POV- Ray through your product. The POV-Team is not
obligated to provide you or your customers any technical support.

    Include a credit page or pages in your documentation for POV-
Ray.

    If you modify any portion POV-Ray for use with your hardware
or software, you must follow the custom version rules in addition
to these rules.

    Include contact and support information for your product.

    Include a full user package as described above.

                 POV-Team ENDORSEMENT PROHIBITIONS
                                 
On rare occasions, the POV-Team endorses distributions in which
POV-Team members are compensated participants and which the POV-
Team has given approval.

Without specific approval, distributors (whether free or
commercial) must not claim or imply in any way that the POV-Team
officially endorses or supports the distributor or the product
(such as CD, book, or magazine) associated with the distribution.

You may not claim or imply that the POV-Team derives any benefit
from your distribution.

If you wish to emphasize that your distribution is legal, you may
use this language "This distribution of the official version of
POV-Ray is permitted under the terms of the General License in the
file POVLEGAL.DOC. The POV- Team does not endorse the distributor
or its products. The POV-Team receives no compensation for this
distribution."

                   RETAIL VALUE OF THIS SOFTWARE
                                 
Although POV-Ray is, when distributed within the terms of this
agreement, free of charge, the retail value (or price) of this
program is determined as US$20.00 per copy distributed or copied.
If the software is distributed or copied without authorization you
are legally liable to this debt to the copyright holder or any
other person or organization delegated by the copyright holder for
the collection of this debt, and you agree that you are legally
bound by the above and will pay this debt within 30 days of the
event.

However, none of the above paragraph constitutes permission for
you to distribute this software outside of the terms of this
agreement. In particular, the conditions and debt mentioned above
(whether paid or unpaid) do not allow you to avoid statutory
damages or other legal penalties and does not constitute any
agreement that would allow you to avoid such other legal remedies
as are available to the copyright holder.

Put simply, POV-Ray is only free if you comply with our
distribution conditions; it is not free otherwise. The copyright
holder of this software chooses to give it away free under these
and only these conditions.

For the purpose of copyright regulations, the retail value of this
software is US$20.00 per copy.

                         OTHER PROVISIONS
                                 
The team permits and encourages the creation of programs,
including commercial packages, which import, export or translate
files in the POV-Ray Scene Description Language. There are no
restrictions on use of the language itself. We reserve the right
to add or remove or change any part of the language.

"POV-Ray", "Persistence of Vision", "POV-Team" and "POV-Help" are
trademarks of the POV-Team.

While we do not claim any restrictions on the letters "POV" alone,
we humbly request that you not use POV in the name of your
product. Such use tends to imply it is a product of the POV-Team.
Existing programs which used "POV" prior to the publication of
this document need not feel guilty for doing so provided that you
make it clear that the program is not the work of the team nor
endorsed by us.

                       REVOCATION OF LICENSE
                                 
VIOLATION OF THIS LICENSE IS A VIOLATION OF COPYRIGHT LAWS. IT
WILL RESULT IN REVOCATION OF ALL DISTRIBUTION PRIVILEGES AND MAY
RESULT IN CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTY.

Such violators who are prohibited from distribution will be
identified in this document.

In this regard, "PC Format", a magazine published by Future
Publishing, Ltd. in the United Kingdom, distributed incomplete
versions of POV-Ray 1.0 in violation the license which was effect
at the time. They later attempted to distribute POV-Ray 2.2
without prior permission of the POV- Team in violation the license
which was in effect at the time. There is evidence that other
Future Publishing companies have also violated our terms.
Therefore "PC Format", and any other magazine, book or CD-ROM
publication owned by Future Publishing is expressly prohibited
from any distribution of POV-Ray software until further notice.

                            DISCLAIMER
