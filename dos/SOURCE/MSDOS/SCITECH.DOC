The POV-Ray Team has been given explicit permission to include these files
in the MS-Dos version of POV-Ray.  Here is an overview of what the files do.

CONSOLE.C and CONSOLE.H provide functions to display and manipulate text
on the console using fast routines that directly access video memory.  These
routines are required for our module MSDOSTXT.C.  If for some reason you 
don't want the fancy text, undefine FANCY_TEXT in CONFIG.H and recompile.
You will get the generic "fprintf(stderr,...)" output from POV-Ray.

PMODE.H and PMODE.LIB provide a compiler-independent way to do interrupts,
access real-mode DOS memory or DOS BIOS areas or video memory.  Every
32-bit protected mode compiler does these things differently but PMODE 
insulates you from those differences.  In each of the compiler-specific
directories you will find a file called PMODE.LIB but each of these files
is different.  Each is tailored to that specific compiler.  It is supplied
as a pre-compiled .LIB because part of the code is written in assembly
language and is designed to be assembled with Borland's TASM 4.0 which 
you might not have.

VESAVBE.C and VESAVBE.H provide generic VESA Video BIOS Extensions support
functions, and provide a plug in module for interfacing with VBE graphics
cards. This module calls upon the PMODE.C files to perform DOS extender
specific tasks, and insulates the remaining modules of the details about
interfacing correctly with VBE graphics cards. Note that although the
MSDOSVID.C file calls upon this module, it is important to keep it
separate so that the VESA support can be updated simply by pluggin in
the latest version of this module from SciTech Software's SuperVGA Kit.

In keeping with POV-Ray's philosophy of full source code availability, we
have included the source to the Zen Timer libraries and the PM/Pro libraries
which will allow you to re-assemble and recompile if you have TASM available.
Note that these three files are not necessary if you plan to use the
already compiled PMODE.LIB and ZTIMER.LIB files.

DEBUG.H is an additional header that is used by CONSOLE.H and PMODE.H and
is required to compile POV-Ray for MS-Dos.

ZTIMER.H and ZTIMER.LIB are an interrupt driven routine to provide timing
functions for POV-Ray speed profiling histogram option.  Like PMODE.LIB,
the ZTIMER.LIB exists in different versions for different compilers.  
Therefore ZTIMER.LIB is not in SOURCE\MSDOS but is in a compiler
specific directory.  UZLTIMER.C and LZTIMER.ASM are the source code to
ZTIMER.LIB but you will probably not need them.

The POV-Ray Team knows just enough about SciTech's modules to make them
work for our limited purposes.  We cannot provide technical support for them.
More details on these SciTech modules is available in their full packages.
