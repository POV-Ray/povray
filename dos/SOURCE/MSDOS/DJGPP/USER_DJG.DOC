USER DOCUMENTATION FOR POV-Ray FOR MS-DOS USING DJGPP VERSION

1.0   Introduction

The Borland compiled version of POV-Ray is designated by ".msdos.gcc" after 
the POV-Ray version number on the opening banner.  Everything in this 
document ONLY applies to that version.  Other versions will operate under 
different rules.  This file is NOT the only documentation for POV-Ray.  
There is a file called POVMSDOS.DOC which covers the MSDOS-specific 
features but that still isn't everything.  There is a hypertext utility 
POVHELP.EXE that reads a file POVHELP.PHE which contains the main 
documentation for POV-Ray itself that is common to all versions.  

This version has been compiled as a 32-bit DOS protected mode application.  
It must be run on a 386 or higher system with at least 4 meg of memory.  
More memory is preferred.

More memory is preferred.

DJGPP compiled programs require a DPMI server to be installed.  If you run 
under Windows or OS/2 it will provide DPMI service.  Quarterdeck's QDPMI 
will also work.  Finally the DJGPP compiler comes with a freeware DPMI 
utility called CWSDPMI that works well too.

3.0   Conclusion

Be sure to read POVMSDOS.DOC and run POVHELP to make sure you have all the 
remaining documentation.  This file only applies to the DJGPP compiled 
version.  Also read POVWHERE.GET for more information on POV-Ray archives 
and support information.
