USER DOCUMENTATION FOR POV-Ray FOR MS-DOS USING BORLAND VERSION

1.0   Introduction

The Borland compiled version of POV-Ray is designated by ".msdos.bcc" after 
the POV-Ray version number on the opening banner.  Everything in this 
document ONLY applies to that version.  Other versions will operate under 
different rules.  This file is NOT the only documentation for POV-Ray.  
There is a file called MSDOS.DOC which covers the MSDOS-specific features 
but that still isn't everything.  There is an archive called POVDOC.ZIP 
which contains the main documentation for POV-Ray itself that is common to 
all versions.  POVDOC.ZIP also contains other REQUIRED files.

2.0   Memory Usage

This version has been compiled as a 32-bit DOS protected mode application.  
It must be run on a 386 or higher system with at least 4 meg of memory.  
More memory is preferred.

The program comes with two files 32RTM.EXE and DPMI32VM.OVL which must be 
in the execution directory or available in your DOS PATH.  Additionally the 
file WINDPMI.386 is required when running under Windows.  See part 4.0 on 
Windows below.  When you run POV-Ray, it first automatically runs the 
Borland 32-bit run-time manager 32RTM.EXE and then loads POV-Ray.  32RTM 
then detects whether or not DPMI services are available.  

2.1   Existing DPMI

If there are existing DPMI services available then POV-Ray will use the 
existing DPMI.  It is then up to the existing DPMI server to manage memory 
and to create and use a virtual memory swap file if needed.  For example in 
a dos box under Windows, the DPMI is managed by Windows.  Under DOS alone 
DPMI services might be provided by Quarterdeck's QDPMI or some other memory 
manager you might be using.

2.2   No DPMI available

If no existing DPMI services are found, then DPMI32VM.OVL is automatically 
loaded and it provides DPMI services of its own.  The Borland DPMI32 server 
then takes all available VCPI, XMS and Extended memory unless you specify 
otherwise via an environment variable.  An environment variable also 
specifies the location of a virtual memory swap file.  In your AUTOEXEC.BAT 
file put the line...

SET DPMIMEM=MAXMEM nnn

or

SET DPMI32=MAXMEM nnn SWAPFILE d:\path\filename

 ... where nnn specifies the maximum number of kilobytes of physical memory 
to use and "d:\path\filename" is the drive, path and name of the swap file.  
Before using a swap file for virtual memory, you must first create one 
using the utility MAKESWAP.EXE which is provided.  

Usage: makeswap Kbytes [swapfile]

 Creates a swap file for the 32bit DPMI server to use.  Kbytes is the size
of the swap file in Kbytes 4K<Kbytes<1024M, and will be rounded down
to the nearest 4K boundary. If swapfile name is not specified, it
will default to edpmi.swp in the current directory.

e.g.: makeswap 4096
      makeswap 0x2000
      makeswap 4M
      makeswap 4M c:edpmi.swp

Note that the environment variables and swap file discussed are only used 
if no DPMI services are available.

2.2   Spawning applications

The DPMI 0.9 specification doesn't allow 32-bit and 16-bit protected mode 
programs to coexist.  32RTM takes care of the problem and allows 16-bit or 
32-bit applications to be spawned.  POV-Ray spawns other programs in the 
Pre_Render_Command, Pre_Frame_Command, Post_Render_Command and 
Post_Frame_Command options.  

Some applications may want to spawn POV-Ray.  If it is a 32-bit program 
then there should be no problem.  However if it is a 16-bit protected mode 
program then you will have to install 32RTM before the 16-bit application.

3.0   Floating Point Emulation

POV-Ray depends on lots of floating point calculations.  It is best run on 
486-DX or Pentium processors with built-in floating point hardware.  A 386 
with a 387 co-processor or a 486-SX with 487 also has hardware floating 
point power but is not as fast as built-in floating point.  Warning some 
so-called "586" chips that are not true Pentiums do not have hardware 
floating point.

POV-Ray can still run no floating point processor is available.  32RTM will 
provide software floating point emulation but hardware floating point is 
usually 7 to 10 times faster.

4.0   Other Operating Systems

This version of POV-Ray will run under MS-Dos 4.01 or later.  It will run 
under OS/2.2X or later in a DOS box.  It will run in Windows 3.1 or 3.11 in 
a DOS box.  It will not run under Windows NT because it directly accesses 
video and dos memory.

If you run it from Windows in a DOS box you must first have WINDPMI.386 
installed.  Copy the WINDPMI.386 to your \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.  Then 
edit your \WINDOWS\SYSTEM.INI file.  Find the [386Enh] section and add the 
line...

 [386Enh]
 device=WINDPMI.386

5.0   Conclusion

Be sure to read POVMSDOS.DOC and run POVHELP to make sure you have all the 
remaining documentation.  This file only applies to the Borland compiled 
version.  Also read POVWHERE.GET for more information on POV-Ray archives 
and support information.
