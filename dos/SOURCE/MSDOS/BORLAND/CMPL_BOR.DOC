      COMPILING DOCUMENTATION FOR POV-Ray FOR MS-DOS USING BORLAND C 

1.0   INTRODUCTION AND DISCLAIMERS

This documentation is to help you compile the portable C source code into a 
working executable version of POV-Ray for MS-Dos using a Borland C 
compiler.  The Borland compiled version of POV-Ray is designated by 
".msdos.bcc" after the POV-Ray version number on the opening banner.  
Everything in this document ONLY applies to that version.  Other versions 
will operate under different rules.  This file is NOT the only compiling 
documentation for POV-Ray.  Before proceeding any farther, you should first 
read the file COMPILE.DOC in the root directory of the source archive.  It 
provides important information about the generic parts of POV-Ray.  Also 
read SOURCE\MSDOS\CMPL_MSD.DOC which provides MS-Dos specific information.

When this document refers to "this directory" it means the 
SOURCE\MSDOS\BORLAND directory.  All of the compiler-specific files for 
this version are found in there.  The makefiles are designed under the 
assumption that you are compiling from this directory.  

This documentation DOES NOT tell you how to use POV-Ray for MS-Dos.  It is 
assumed you already have obtained the official executable archive compiled 
for MS-Dos and that you are familiar with using it.  It contains essential 
user documentation, sample scenes and standard scene include files.  User 
documentation is in the executable archive in the hypertext file 
POVHELP.PHE.  The executable archive also includes a help reader program to 
read PHE files and utilities to translate PHE into other forms.  MS-Dos 
specific user documentation is in the text file POVMSDOS.DOC in the 
executable archive.  Borland specific user documentation can be found in 
CMPL_BOR.DOC in this directory.

The first question you should ask yourself before proceeding is "Do I 
really need to compile POV-Ray at all?"  If you do not intend to add any 
custom or experimental features to the program, or to port it to an 
unsupported compiler you need not compile this program yourself.

As explained in COMPILE.DOC, if you do want to proceed you should be aware 
that you are very nearly on your own.  This documentation and other related 
compiling documentation assumes you know what you are doing.  In general 
you should not expect any technical support from the POV-Ray Team on how to 
compile the program.  Everything is provided here "as is".  All we can say 
with any certainty is that we were able to compile it on our system.  If it 
doesn't work for you, we probably cannot tell you why.

When making any custom version of POV-Ray or any unofficial compile, please 
make sure you read and follow all provisions of our license in the file 
POVLEGAL.DOC.  In general you can modify and use POV-Ray on your own 
however you want but if you distribute your unofficial version you must 
follow our rules.  You may not under any circumstances use portions of POV-
Ray source code in other programs.


2.0   SUPPORTED COMPILER VERSIONS

POV-Ray 3.0 must be compiled using a 32-bit protected mode, flat memory 
model compiler for 386 CPU or better.  It cannot be compiled as a real mode 
or 286 protected mode program.  It cannot be compiled in small, medium, 
large or even huge memory models.  

We recommend the BC++ 4.52 with the Dos Power Pack.  The Borland compiler 
is the fastest compiling C compiler we have ever seen.  The resulting 
executable is not as fast as Watcom but the dos extender has no memory 
limits.  BC++ alone, is NOT sufficient to compile a 32-bit dos program.  
You MUST have an add-on package called the Dos Power Pack.  The Dos Power 
Pack works with versions from BC++ 4.02 through BC++ 4.52 and we have 
successfully compiled.  

PLEASE NOTE: The current Borland release BC++ 5.0 does not officially 
support the Dos Power Pack.  The last time we checked, the Dos Power Pack 
was no longer for sale.  We have been told that it is still possible to use 
the command-line 5.0 compiler with an old Dos Power Pack to create 32-bit 
Dos programs but we have not personally verified this.  


3.0   Libraries

This version requires 4 libraries.  Pre-compiled versions of these 
libraries are provided in this directory.  The first 2, LIBPNG.LIB and 
ZLIB.LIB add support for PNG format files.  If you need to re-compile them 
for any reason, you may use the batch file BUILDPNG.BAT.  It will log to 
the ..\..\ZLIB directory, erase any previously compiled lib, re-compile 
ZLIB, copy it to this directory, and cleans up the ZLIB directory.  Then it 
does the same for LIBPNG.LIB and the ..\..\LIBPNG directory.

PMODE.LIB provides access to video and dos memory from protected mode.  
ZTIMER.LIB provides a precision timer for the histogram profiling feature.  
There are source files in SOURCE\MSDOS\PMODE and SOURCE\MSDOS\ZTIMER but we 
have not provided make files.  Parts of these libs are written in assembler 
and require Borland Tasm 4.0 to re-compile.  For this reason we suggest you 
do not attempt to re-compile them unless you absolutely have to do so.

4.0   Compiling

To compile POV-Ray type the following command from this directory...

  MAKE -fMSDOSBC.MAK

The Borland compiler will compile each FILE.C into an object file such as 
FILE.OBJ and these object files are linked with the libs to create 
POVRAY.EXE.  If you do not plan to re-compile, you may DEL *.OBJ to save 
space.  If you do plan to re-compile, the MAKE utility will compile only 
those files which have changed.
