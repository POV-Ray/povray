Mesa Multithreaded Demos README
-------------------------------

  This directory contains demos programs which can be used to verify
proper operation of an MT-safe build of Mesa.  Some of these demos
are non-portable at present, but will be more generally useful in 
future versions of Mesa. 

  To build the demo(s), just type "make" in conjunction with the same
build target you used to build the MT-safe Mesa lib.

Examples:
  make -f Makefile.X11 sunos5-pthread      (for Solaris 2.[56] with POSIX threads)
  make -f Makefile.X11 linux-386-pthread   (for Linux 2.x systems with Linux threads)


If you have questions or problems with these demo programs, send email
to John Stone or Cristoph Poliwoda.  (see README.THREADS in top level 
Mesa directory)

mt_osdemo.c -- Renders using multiple threads, and one ore more osmesa 
               rendering contexts.  Requires pthreads currently.
