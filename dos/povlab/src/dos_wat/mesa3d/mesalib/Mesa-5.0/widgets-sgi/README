This directory contains the source code for SGI's OpenGL Xt/Motif widgets,
slightly modified by Jeroen van der Zijp to work better with Mesa.

To compile the widget code (producing lib/libGLw.a) cd to the widgets/
directory and type 'make <config>' where <config> is the system configuration
you used to compile Mesa (like 'make linux').  This hasn't been tested on
many systems so let us know if you have trouble.

If you want to make a Linux ELF shared lib instead of the non-shared .a
file see the notes in the Makefile.

If you want to build with Motif support, edit Makefile.X11, looking
for the "Motif" information.
