The Mesa distribution consists of several components.  Different copyrights
and licenses apply to different components.  For example, GLUT is copyrighted
by Mark Kilgard, some demo programs are copyrighted by SGI, some of the Mesa
device drivers are copyrighted by their authors.  See below for a list of
Mesa's components and the copyright/license for each.

The core Mesa library is licensed according to the terms of the XFree86
copyright (an MIT-style license).  This allows integration with the
XFree86/DRI project.  Unless otherwise stated, the Mesa source code and
documentation is licensed as follows:

Contributors:

When contributing to the Mesa project you must agree to relinquish your
work to the holder of the copyright for the particular component you're
contributing to.  That is, you can't put your own copyright on the code,
unless it's a modular piece that can be omitted from Mesa (like a new
device driver).  If for example, you contribute a bug fix to Mesa's
texture mapping code, your code will become a part of the body of work
which is copyrighted by Brian Paul and licensed by the above terms.

NVIDIA vertex program license:

Mesa 4.1 includes an implementation of the GL_NV_vertex_program extension
designed by NVIDIA Corporation.  Implementing the extension requires a
license from NVIDIA.  The license agreement for Mesa's implementation of
GL_NV_vertex_program follows:


   Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
   modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:

   o Redistribution of the source code must contain a copyright notice
     and this list of conditions;

   o Redistribution in binary and source code form must contain the
     following Notice in the software and any documentation and/or other
     materials provided with the distribution; and

   o The name of Nvidia may not be used to promote or endorse software
     derived from the software.

   NOTICE: Nvidia hereby grants to each recipient a non-exclusive worldwide
   royalty free patent license under patent claims that are licensable by
   Nvidia and which are necessarily required and for which no commercially
   viable non infringing alternative exists to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
   import and otherwise transfer the vertex extension for the Mesa 3D Graphics
   Library as distributed in source code and object code form.  No hardware or
   hardware implementation (including a semiconductor implementation and chips)
   are licensed hereunder. If a recipient makes a patent claim or institutes
   patent litigation against Nvidia or Nvidia's customers for use or sale of
   Nvidia products, then this license grant as to such recipient shall
   immediately terminate and recipient immediately agrees to cease use and
   distribution of the Mesa Program and derivatives thereof. 

   THE MESA 3D GRAPHICS LIBRARY IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT
   WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING,
   WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-NFRINGEMENT
   MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

   NVIDIA SHALL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
   SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
   LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
   CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
   ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE MESA 3D GRAPHICS
   LIBRARY OR EVIDENCE OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDR, EVEN
   IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

   If you do not comply with this agreement, then Nvidia may cancel the license
   and rights granted herein.


It basically says that anyone is free to redistribute Mesa with this
extension, the extension must be conformant to the GL_NV_vertex_program
specification, hardware implementations are not permitted, and NVIDIA
Corporation can't be held responsible for any problems encountered while
using this code.
