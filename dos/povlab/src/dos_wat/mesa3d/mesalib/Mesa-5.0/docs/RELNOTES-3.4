Introduction
------------

Mesa uses an even/odd version number scheme like the Linux kernel.
Odd numbered versions (such as 3.3) designate new developmental releases.
Even numbered versions (such as 3.4) designate stable releases.

Mesa 3.4 simply fixes bugs found in the Mesa 3.3 release.  For details,
see the VERSIONS file.
