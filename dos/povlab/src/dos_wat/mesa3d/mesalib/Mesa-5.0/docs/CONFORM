The SGI OpenGL conformance tests verify correct operation of OpenGL
implementations.  This file has the latest results of testing Mesa
with the OpenGL 1.2 conformance tests.  Testing with the preliminary
OpenGL 1.3 tests has also been done.  Mesa passes all the 1.3 tests.

The tests were run using the software X11 device driver on 24-bpp
and 16-bpp displays.

At this time Mesa 4.0 passes all conformance tests at all path levels.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

COVERAGE TESTS
--------------

Test that all API functions accept the legal parameters and reject
illegal parameters.  The result of each test is either pass or fail.
