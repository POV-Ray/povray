Introduction
------------

Mesa uses an even/odd version number scheme like the Linux kernel.
Odd numbered versions (such as 3.3) designate new developmental releases.
Even numbered versions (such as 3.4) designate stable releases.

Mesa 3.4.2 is a maintenance release that simply fixes bugs found since
the Mesa 3.4.1 release.  For details, see the VERSIONS file.
