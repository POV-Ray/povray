                             PLEASE READ!!!!



The Mesa 3.2.1 release mainly just fixes bugs since the 3.2 release.
See the VERSIONS file for the exact list.



GLU Polygon Tessellator
-----------------------

The GLU tessellator has been reverted back to the version included
with Mesa 3.0 since it's more stable.  The Mesa 3.1/3.2 tessellator
implemented the GLU 1.3 specification but suffered from a number of
bugs.

Mesa implements GLU 1.1.

Ideally, people should use the GLU 1.3 library included in SGI's
OpenGL Sample Implementation (SI) available from 
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/
People are working to make easy-to-install Linux RPMs of the
GLU library.
