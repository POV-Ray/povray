/* The default pipeline.  This is useful for software rasterizers, and
 * simple hardware rasterizers.  For customization, I don't recommend
 * tampering with the internals of these stages in the way that
 * drivers did in Mesa 3.4.  These stages are basically black boxes,
 * and should be left intact.
 *
 * To customize the pipeline, consider:
 *
 * - removing redundant stages (making sure that the software rasterizer
 *   can cope with this on fallback paths).  An example is fog
 *   coordinate generation, which is not required in the FX driver.
 *
 * - replacing general-purpose machine-independent stages with
 *   general-purpose machine-specific stages.  There is no example of
 *   this to date, though it must be borne in mind that all subsequent
 *   stages that reference the output of the new stage must cope with
 *   any machine-specific data introduced.  This may not be easy
 *   unless there are no such stages (ie the new stage is the last in
 *   the pipe).
 *
 * - inserting optimized (but specialized) stages ahead of the
 *   general-purpose fallback implementation.  For example, the old
 *   fastpath mechanism, which only works when the VERT_BIT_ELT input is
 *   available, can be duplicated by placing the fastpath stage at the
 *   head of this pipeline.  Such specialized stages are currently
 *   constrained to have no outputs (ie. they must either finish the *
 *   pipeline by returning GL_FALSE from run(), or do nothing).
 *
 * Some work can be done to lift some of the restrictions in the final
 * case, if it becomes necessary to do so.
