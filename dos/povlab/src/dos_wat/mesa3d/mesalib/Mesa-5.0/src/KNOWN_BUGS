Performance issues with EXT_point_parameters & quake2



Using glPolygonMode() where the front and back modes aren't the
same causes poor performance on 3Dfx.



Broken drivers: some of the Mesa device drivers (such as BeOS, D3D,
etc) haven't been updated for Mesa 3.3's device driver changes.



glDrawRangeElements() should use vertex array locking to improve performance
but trying to do so causes a rendering error.  Reported by Scott McMillan.
Fixed by disabling locking in glDrawRangeElements (varray.c) but that's
really just hiding a bug in array locking.
