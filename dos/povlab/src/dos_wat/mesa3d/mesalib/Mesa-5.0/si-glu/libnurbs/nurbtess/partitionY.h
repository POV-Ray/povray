 *partitionY.h:
 *partition a polygon into a Y-monotone polygon:
 * A polygon is Y-monotone if the boundary can be split into two polygon chains
 *A and B such that each chain is Y-monotonic that is the intersection of any
 *horizontal line intersects each chain has at most one connected componenets
 * (empty, single point or a single line).
 * 
 * A vertex is a cusp if both its ajacent vertices are either at or above v, 
 *or both at or below v. In addition, at least one of the ajacent verteces is
 *strictly below or above v. 
 * A vertex is a relex vertex if the internals angle is strictly greater than 
 *180. In other words, if the the signed area is negative:
 *(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) are the three vertices along a polygon, the 
 *order is such that left hand side is inside the polygon. Then (x2,y2) is
 *reflex if: 
 *  (x2-x1, y2-y1) cross (x3-x1, y3-y1) <0.
 *A vertex is an interior cusp if it is a cusp and a reflex.
 *A vertex is an exterior cusp if it is a cusp but not a reflex.
