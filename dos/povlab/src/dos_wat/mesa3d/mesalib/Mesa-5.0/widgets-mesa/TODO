Some of the things hat need to be done:

GLwDrawingArea:
***************

  * Handle all resources, conform to the manpage.


MesaDrawingArea:
****************

  * Implement the missing resources that are not inherited from
  GLwDrawingArea, callbacks in particular.

  * Check Motif support with ``real'' Motif.

  * Implement the shareListWith resource

MesaWorkstation:
****************

  * Finish the Motif support, in particular the keyboard translations.

  * Rethink the geometry for views to make sure it is intuitive.

  * Sanitize the translations for controlling parametrized views.

  * Maybe implement a MapleV style viewing cube.

  * Rethink Redraw events to find a way for adding backing store.


Demos:
******

  * finish the Motif version of the event display demo.

  * write the Motif version of the tea demo.

  * Fix the colormapping in the Motif demos.


Documentation:
**************

  * As always :-( ...
