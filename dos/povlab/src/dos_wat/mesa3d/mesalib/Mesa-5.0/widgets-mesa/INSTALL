./configure	# add `--with-motif' iff you want the Motif widget
make
make demo.gl
make demo.mesa
make demo.ws	# load `next' event and play with cursor keys
make demo.tea	# play with cursor keys again
make install	# iff you like it

That's it.  Enjoy.

PS:   If you don't build in a Mesa source tree and don't have Mesa's
      header files installed, you can use `--with-mesadir=PATH' as an
      argument to configure to specify another PATH to the Mesa source
      tree.

P^2S: I can not test the Motif widget myself, therefore it is not build
      by default.  But people have used it successfully, it should
      work for you too.

P^3S: A more verbose description will follow ...
