	* began with Motif support for the Mesa* widgets.  Not finished
	yet (e.g. Keyboard translations).

Wed Jan  3 22:32:34 1996  Thorsten Ohl  <ohl@tholix1>

	* configure.in: A few compilation problems fixed by The Net.

Thu Jun  8 11:49:40 1995  Thorsten Ohl  <ohl@localhost>

	* configure.in:  test for memmove() separately.  SunOS has memcopy
	but not memmove() (<Frederic.Devernay@sophia.inria.fr>).

	* use GLPL throughout.  Some files still had a GPL.

Mon Apr 10 21:04:46 1995  Thorsten Ohl  <ohl@localhost>

	* Canonicalize utility function names.  Use GLw* instead of mesa_*
	as common prefix.  Even though I prefer to separate words in
	function names by underscores, it's better to stick to common
	practice, which in X11 programs is captalization.

Sat Apr  8 18:22:21 1995  Thorsten Ohl  <ohl@localhost>

	* configure.in:  --enable-debug

Tue Apr  4 00:13:41 1995  Thorsten Ohl  <ohl@localhost>

	* Makefile.in (demo.*): new targets for debugging specific 8-bit
	visuals

Thu Mar 30 23:03:29 1995  Thorsten Ohl  <ohl@localhost>

	* Makefile.in: SHELL = /bin/sh

	* configure.in (mesa_srcdir): like top_srcdir, pointing to the
	root of the Mesa source tree.
