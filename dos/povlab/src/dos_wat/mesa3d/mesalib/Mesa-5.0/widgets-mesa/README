NOTICE: You probably don't want to use this widget code.  It uses
the "XMesa" interface, not "GLX".  Therefore, it will only work
with Mesa and no other OpenGL implementation.  You should probably
use 'widgets-sgi' instead.


This is a beta release of a widget set for Mesa/OpenGL programming.

Objectives:
***********

  * Provide a GLwDrawingArea widget which is 100%ly compatible with
  SGI's widget.  Applications should port over with (almost) no
  changes to the source code.

  * Add a better widget (MesaDrawingArea) alongside or atop of it.  In
  particular, attach a XMesaContext transparently to the widget.  This
  should simplify applications with multiple widgets considerably.

  * Provide a high level workstation abstraction (MesaWorkstation)
  atop of MesaDrawingArea to allow PHIGS/PEX enthusiasts to continue
  in their style.


Status:
*******

  * The widgets work, but are in differing stages of completion:

    * GLwDrawingArea is almost complete: a couple of resources are
    still ignored and I need to add code to handle cases in which a
    colormap resource is provided explicitely.  Currently, I allocate
    a fresh colormap for RGBA mode and use the default in color index
    mode.

    * GLwMDrawingArea (the Motif version of the above) needs testing.
    Use `./configure --with-motif' to build it.

    * MesaDrawingArea is complete (I think).

    * MesaWorkstation is stabilizing, but changes to the user
    interface are still expected.  The programming interfase is more
    stable, but also subject to change.

  * See also: TODO

  * This code should still be considered late beta, however.
  Comments, bugreports and in particular bugfixes are welcome.

  * PLEASE: the sample code in the demos subdirectory is not to be
  mistaken for examples of good coding practice.  It mushroomed wildly
  during development of the widgets and is only intended for testing.
  It is planned to improve and clean up ed, though.

Trouble Shooting:
*****************

If you get an error such as:

   Error: MesaDrawingArea: unable to find visual

The problem is that the fallback resources specify:

        *MesaDrawingArea.rgba: false

You will need to override this by either installing a suitable
app-defaults file (the supplied one duplicates the fallback
resources), or specifying the value on the command line, e.g.

        ./mcube -xrm "*MesaDrawingArea.rgba: true"
