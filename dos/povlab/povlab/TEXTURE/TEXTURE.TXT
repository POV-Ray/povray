This file describes how to manage textures with the new utilities. For more
information, please read the documentation POVLAB.DOC.

The textures are described by 2 files, POVLAB.TEX and POVLAB.INC.
The first contains library assignments for both the texture's name and
the thumbnail's name. POVLAB.INC is a POV-Ray file like TEXTURES.INC.

I've written 2 utilities to help manage the textures library.
MAKETHEM.EXE is the program that actually manages the library.
TGAVGIF.EXE is a program to convert TGA files to 8 bits GIF files, with
good color reduction and dithering. You can use it for other images besides
texture thumbnails.
It needs DOS4GW.EXE in the path to run.

Here is how to render each thumbnails for unallocated textures names.
Go to the POVLAB\TEXTURE path, run MAKETHEM.EXE.

        MAKE THEM ALL release 1.0, (C) Copyright ChromaGraphics, 1994-1996.
        Texture library maker and manager for POVLAB.

            Syntax : makethem [option(s)]

            -Ppath : specify path for POV-Ray (default current)
            -Ipath : specify file library.TEX (default POVLAB.TEX)
            -D     : display while rendering (+d0)
            -F     : enable Faster Than POV-Ray speedup options (2.2 only)
            -An.n  : use antialiasing rendering option (-A0.3 for example)
            -T     : render all the textures int library.TEX (overwrite)
            -?     : syntax and help screen"

            Example : makethem -pc:\povray -ic:\povlab\povlab.tex

-P : to tell the program where POV-Ray is (just the path)
-I : choose one texture library for POVLAB.
-D : display the rendering image while computing
-F : only for POV-Ray 2.2 users
-A : use antialiasing for better display

Command line
------------
If POV-Ray is in the path and you want to add new thumbnails to your
POVLAB.TEX, just enter "makethem" on the dos prompt.

When POV-Ray isn't in the path
------------------------------
type "makethem -pc:\povray".
Here POV-Ray dir is C:\POVRAY

How it works
------------
First, MAKETHEM will read the POVLAB.TEX file (or the one you've specified) and
check for unallocated texture names.
Then it prepares a .POV file, sends it to POV-Ray, and converts it into
.GIF format with TGAVGIF.EXE.
If you stop the rendering before TGA file is compledted, no .GIF
will be created.

Name the texture thumbnails
---------------------------
MAKETHEM will automatically assign new names to textures thumbnails.
The prefix is TEX followed by 4 digits (e.g. 0000), and then .TGA or .GIF.
You can have up to 9999 files (POVLAB only supports 1000 per .TEX file).           
MAKTHEM will check when it finds an unallocated texture name whether
TEX0000.TGA exists and if it does will continue to check for, 
TEX0001.TGA, TEX0002.TGA etc... and stops until it finds an unallocated name.

Assign names and thumbnails together
------------------------------------
When MAKETHEM has finished, it generates the file MAKETHEM.LOG, which has a 
similar structure to POVLAB.TEX, with names and thumbnails associated.
You can edit the file POVLAB.TEX, add match the new thumbnails file to their
respective names, and then, remove the .TGA files.

Options used in MAKETHEM for POV-Ray and TGAVGIF
------------------------------------------------
POV-Ray : -iTEXTURE.POV -oTEX????.TGA +ft +w100 +h100 +v +mb2 +a +x
TGAVGIF : TEX???? /f /i

Using MAKETHEM and POV-Ray for Windows
--------------------------------------
Althought you can use it with WINPOV (it will find
alone the PVENGINE.EXE exe file), you cannot use it in a good way cos
WINPOV don't wait the render to be finished to continue the process
with MEKETHEM. So TGAVGIF will load the thumbnail and WINPOV will not
finished to render this thumbnail and there will be a lot of errors (cos
MAKETHEM will reload many times WINPOV too).
The better way is to find just a POVRAY.EXE dos version just for rendering
thumbnails for texture previews.
