********* OS/2 setup By Martin Conlon (mconlon@engsoc.carleton.ca)

The SETUPOS2.CMD file is a REXX script to setup POVLAB under OS/2.  It should
be run from the OS/2 command line (in an OS/2 shell) by typing:

SETUPOS2 [enter]

       where "[enter]" indicates that the "enter" key on the keyboard
       should be pressed

The script will setup an icon called "POVLAB" on the desktop.  This icon may
then be dragged into an appropriate folder.

The "POVLAB" icon is setup with the appropriate memory setting required to run
POVLAB successfully under OS/2.  As well, all *.SCN files (POVLAB's scene
files) are liked to the POVLAB executable so that double clicking on one of
them launches POVLAB.  This linking is only apparent after a shutdown and
reboot. (When all scene files get an icon similar to POVLAB's).

*** Note:  At this time, POVLAB is unable to spawn POV-Ray under OS/2.  When the
           OS/2 version of POVRAY becomes available, this file (and the script)
           will be updated.
           In order to render your scenes, you must generate the *.POV file
           using the "-->POV-Ray (.POV)" option in the "File" menu and render
           as you would normally (from the DOS command line).
           The memory settings still need some work.
