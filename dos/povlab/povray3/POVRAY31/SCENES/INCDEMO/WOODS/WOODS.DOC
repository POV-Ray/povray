WOODMAPS.INC
============
This file contains color_maps used by woods.inc.  There are two types of
color_maps used; the first, the "WoodMapxA" color_maps, are intended as
the 1st layer of multi-layer textures, although many will work quite well
by themselves, as single layer texture color_maps.

The second, the "WoodMapxB" color_maps, contain transparent colors and are
intended for use as top layers in conjunction with the "WoodMapxA" maps.

There is a complimentary "B" map for each "A" map in the file.  The maps
are each numbered (the "x" in "WoodMapxA" and "WoodMapxB") from 1 to 19.
Thus, WoodMap19A has a complimentary top layer defined as WoodMap19B.

WOODS.INC
=========
These textures do not have colormaps assigned in them.  This is so they
you can mix and match with the colormaps in WOODMAPS.INC as described
above.

All wood textures are designed with the major axis of the woodgrain
"cylinder" aligned along the Z axis.  With the exception of a few
of the textures in this file that have a small amount of X-axis rotation
built-in for best effect, the textures below will exhibit a very straight
grain pattern unless you apply a small amount of X-axis rotation to them
(generally 2-4 degrees will suffice).

Study the scene files in the WOODS subdirectory to see how to use these
textures.  We would strongly advise that you render all of these files
and keep them around for reference purposes.

These  textures really need to be rendered with antialiasing and at
least 640x480 resolution to get the most out of them.  Anything less
than that and you won't be seeing them as they were designed.

The WOOD_x.POV files display the woods.inc textures on wooden slabs that
are arranged on the x/y plane.  The slabs have somewhat rounded edges to
display the effects of the woodgrain on non-flat surfaces.  These files
use both TESTCAM.INC and TESTOBJS.INC.

WOODS.POV is another scene that demonstrates all of the 30 woodgrains
defined in woods.inc.  If you're short on harddrive space and can't
afford to keep samples of all of the woodgrains around, then at least
retain a copy of the WOODS.TGA image around for reference purposes.
