ADDITIONAL WOOD TEXTURES:
=========================

In addition to the woods listed in WOODS.INC, there are several
additional new wood textures defined in the following files.  These
textures use pigments defined in WOODS.INC, but they use 256 entry
colormaps that are defined in files of the same name, but with a file
extension of ".MAP" (ie: ASH.POV uses ASH.MAP).  The names of these
files are:

        ASH.POV....... ASH.MAP
        BUBINGA.POV... BUBINGA.MAP
        CEDAR.POV..... CEDAR.MAP
        ORNGWOOD.POV.. ORNGWOOD.MAP
        TEAK.POV...... TEAK.MAP
        WHITEASH.POV.. WHITEASH.MAP

The color maps for these files were designed by pulling the color map
from scanned images of actual textures.  The images were first converted
to .GIF format, loaded into Fractint where the color map was saved,
sorted with a text editor, and converted into a POV-Ray style colormap
with the program FMAP2POV.EXE.
