                 PLATFORM SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR MS-Dos


This file contains the documentation that is specific to the MS-Dos version 
of POV-Ray.  It is not the full documentation for the program.  Other 
documentation you will need is:

  USER_???.DOC  This contains technical info about memory usage, how to
                configure the memory manager and other info that is
                specific to the compiler that was used to create the
                program.  The ??? may be WAT for Watcom, BCC for Borland
                or GCC for DJGPP Gnu Compiler.
  POVUSER.TXT   This is a plain ASCII text file containing the full 
                tutorial and reference guide for POV-Ray.  It covers all
                features in detail.

NOTE: The MS-Dos version of POV-Ray no longer contains the hypertext help
program POVHELP.EXE.  It was too difficult to maintain documentation in
that format.  We realize that ASCII text is not a good substitute. However
most MS-Dos users also have Windows 3.x or Windows 95/98/NT available. If
you have Windows 95/98/NT then you should obtain the Windows version of 
POV-Ray.  It has POVUSER.HLP which contains the same information as 
POVUSER.TXT in nicely formatted hypertext help form with illustrations.
If you don't want to use POV-Ray for Windows 95/98/NT or only have 
Windows 3.x then check out POVUSER.PDF in Adobe Acrobat PDF format. The
Acrobat Reader is available for free at http://www.adobe.com and runs
on Windows, Mac, & Unix.  Finally POVHTML.ZIP is an archive containing
the povuser information in html format for viewing with an internet 
browser.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
      POV-Ray requires a 386 or better CPU with at least 4 meg of ram.  
Faster 486-DX or Pentium processors are recommended.  A 386 or 486-sx does 
not have built-in floating point math capability so it will run very slow.  
Adding a 387 or 487 co-processor will increase speed 7 to 10 fold.  
      This version runs in MS-Dos or as an MS-Dos application under Windows 
3.x, Windows 95, Windows NT and OS/2.  A Windows 95/98/NT specific version
is also available.
      While it is working, POV-Ray can display the image on a VGA or SVGA 
graphics system.  Older CGA, EGA or Mono video cannot use the graphics 
preview but it can still create an image file.
      In addition to the programs supplied in this package, you will need a 
text editor or word processing program that can read, edit and save plain, 
unformatted ASCII text files.  The EDIT program that comes with MS-Dos will 
work for moderate size files.  You will need some sort of image viewer to 
see the images.  One that supports TGA, GIF, and PNG formats is 
recommended.  If you want to turn TGA files into animations we recommend a 
program called Dave's Targa Animator (DTA.EXE) and an animation viewer such 
as AAPLAY or Trilobyte PLAY.  Such programs are available at www.povray.org 
or are usually available where you obtained POV-Ray.
      These instructions assume you have a basic knowledge of how to work 
with directories and files under dos.  It assumes you know what the dos 
path is; what an environment variable is; and how to edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT 
file to change the path or environment.  The install program will offer to 
edit the path for you but if something goes wrong you may need to change it 
yourself.  If you do not have knowledge about directories, paths, batch 
files or editors, your local bookstore has many tutorial books available 
that will help you.  Don't be intimidated by the insulting titles of such 
books.  The only true "dummies" are those who give up trying.


BASIC USAGE
-----------
      NOTICE!  IF YOU DID NOT INSTALL THE PROGRAM USING THE INSTALL.EXE
SYSTEM, THE EXAMPLES AND INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN HERE MAY NOT WORK!  THE
INSTALLATION PROCESS CONFIGURES POVRAY.INI AND SEVERAL IMPORTANT BATCH 
FILES.  WITHOUT THESE FILES CONFIGURED, THE EXAMPLES HEREIN MAY NOT WORK.
      POV-Ray's basic purpose is to read a scene description written in the 
POV language and to write an image file.  The scene files are plain ASCII 
text files that you create using a text editor.  Dozens of sample files are 
included with this package to illustrate the various features.
      You invoke POV-Ray by typing a command at the MS-Dos prompt.  The 
command is "POVRAY" and it must be followed by one or more command line 
switches.  Each switch begins with a plus or minus sign.  Blanks separate 
the switches.  The switches may be upper or lower case.
      Note: The examples in this documentation assume you installed POV-Ray 
in the C:\POVRAY31 directory.  The installer will let you install POV-Ray 
anywhere and will properly configure it for the drive and directory you 
specified.  You just substitute that drive and directory anywhere we tell
you to use C:\POVRAY31.  Change to that directory now.  Then type the
following command line and press [ENTER]

POVRAY +ISHAPES +D1 

      The +I command (that's "i" for "input") tells the program what file 
to read as input.  If you don't give an extension on the file name, .POV is 
assumed.  Thus +ISHAPES tells it to read in SHAPES.POV to be rendered.  
      The +D switch (for "display") tells the program to turn the graphic 
preview display on.  A "-D" would turn it off.  The number "1" tells it 
what type of display to use.  Type 1 is the old fashioned standard generic 
VGA at 320 by 200 resolution and just 256 colors.  This is pretty much 
guaranteed to work on any VGA video system.  
      There are other options in effect besides those you typed on the 
command line.  They are stored in a file called POVRAY.INI which was 
created by the install system.  POV-Ray automatically looks for this file 
in the same directory where POVRAY.EXE resides.  See "USING INI FILES" 
below for more information on POVRAY.INI and other INI files.
      When you enter the command shown above, you will see brightly colored 
geometric shapes begin to appear as POV-Ray calculates the color of each 
pixel row by row.  You will probably be disappointed with the graphic 
display results.  That is because this is only a preview display.  The 
actual image is in full 24-bit color but we cannot display that high 
quality using simple VGA with a fixed set of 256 colors.  If your hardware 
supports the VESA interface standard or you have a VESA TSR driver loaded, 
try running with +DG rather than +D1.  This will give you access to all of 
the various modes your video hardware can use.  If you have 15-bit or 16-
bit high color capability try +DGH or if you have 24-bit true color 
capability try +DGT to see the image in all its glory.  See "DISPLAY TYPES" 
below for more information on graphics preview.
      When the program finishes, you will hear beeps.  After admiring the 
image, press [ENTER].  You will see a text screen of statistics.  If the 
text is too much to fit on the screen you may press cursor up or down keys 
to read more text.  Notice that there are tabs at the bottom of the screen.  
Press cursor left or right keys to view other interesting text information.  
Press [ENTER] again to exit POV-Ray.
      If you do not have high color or true color ability you will have to 
view the image file to see the real colors.  The image file SHAPES.TGA is 
written to your current directory.  By default POV-Ray creates files in TGA 
format.  This is a standard format for storing 24-bit true-color images.  
You will need an image viewing program to view the file.  Such programs are 
usually available from the same place where you obtained POV-Ray but a 
viewer is not included in this package.
      If you cannot view TGA files you may add the switch +FN and POV-Ray 
will output PNG (Portable Network Graphic) format.  If PNG format viewer is 
not available then type the following:

T2G SHAPES

and press [ENTER].  This will run a batch file that invokes the TGA2GIF 
program.  The program will read your SHAPES.TGA file, create an optimal 256 
color palette and write a GIF format file SHAPES.GIF.  Most image viewing 
programs support GIF.


RUNNING FILES IN OTHER DIRECTORIES
----------------------------------
      Normally POV-Ray only looks in the current directory for the files it 
needs.  It does not search your MS-Dos path for data files; it only 
searches for programs.  In the sample scene you just ran, file SHAPES.POV 
was in the current directory so this was no problem.  That scene also 
needed other files but your POVRAY.INI file tells POV-Ray other places to 
search for necessary files.
      If you allowed the install system to update your AUTOEXEC.BAT file,
then you can change to any drive or directory and can run POV-Ray from that
directory.  You will also be able to use the batch files and utilities that
came with this package in any directory.  For future reference let's call 
the "use-C:\POVRAY31-in-your-path-plan" as "PLAN 1".
      There are some circumstances where you may not want to put C:\POVRAY31 
in your path.  There is a limit of 128 characters in your path statement 
and you may not have room for it.  Try rendering the SHAPES example from a 
different directory.  If it doesn't work, then you forgot to re-boot your 
system so the new path takes effect.  If after re-booting it still doesn't 
work, it probably means your path is too full.  You will have to adopt a 
different plan.
      Chances are, you already have several directories in your path.  Most 
systems have C:\DOS, C:\WINDOWS or some directory such as C:\UTILITY 
already in the path.  We have provided several small batch files that you 
can copy to that directory.  For future reference we'll call the 
"put-batch-files-in-a-directory-already-on-the-path-plan" as "PLAN 2".
      At any dos prompt, type the word PATH and press [ENTER].  It will 
show you what directories are already on your path.  Then copy the 
following files from your C:\POVRAY31 directory to any of the directories 
already on your path.  The files are:

  RUNPOV.BAT  RERUNPOV.BAT  T2G.BAT  

      Once you have copied these files, try this example...  In this case, 
do not invoke the program with the command "POVRAY".  Instead use "RUNPOV" 
as follows:

cd \POVRAY31\SCENES\ADVANCED
RUNPOV +IWOODBOX +D1

      This changes to the \POVRAY31\SCENES\ADVANCED directory where the file 
WOODBOX.POV is found.  It runs the file RUNPOV.BAT.  That batch file is set 
up to run POV-Ray even if it is not on the dos path.  It also passes the 
switches along to POV-Ray.  These batch files have other uses, even if you 
are using "PLAN 1" as described above or "PLAN 3" as described below.  For 
more on these batch files, see "USING BATCH FILES" below.
      All of the early examples in this document assumed you were running 
POV-Ray from the directory where it was installed such as C:\POVRAY31.  This 
approach of always using the installation directory is in fact "PLAN 3".  
If you are using this method, you need to tell POV-Ray where else to look 
for files.  In the case of WOODBOX.POV you could do this:

POVRAY +IC:\POVRAY31\SCENES\ADVANCED\WOODBOX +D1

      However some scenes need more than one file.  For example the 
directory \POVRAY31\SCENES\ADVANCED\DRUMS2 contains three files: DRUMS.POV, 
DRUMS.INC and REDNEWT.PNG all of which are required for that one scene. In 
this case you should use the +L switch ("L" for "library") to add new 
library paths to those that POV-Ray will search.  You would render the 
scene with this command.

POVRAY +L\POVRAY31\SCENES\ADVANCED\DRUMS2 +IDRUMS +D1


USING INI FILES
---------------
      There were more options used in these renderings than just the 
switches +I, +D, and +L that you specify.  When you run the program, POV-
Ray automatically looks for the file POVRAY.INI in whatever directory that 
POVRAY.EXE is in.  The POVRAY.INI file contains many options that control 
how POV-Ray works.  We have set this file up so that it is especially easy 
to run your first scene with minimal problems.  The file should be placed 
in the same directory as POVRAY.EXE and it will automatically be read when 
POVRAY is run.  If you ever move POVRAY.EXE to a different directory, be 
sure to move POVRAY.INI too.
      Complete details on all of the available switches and options that 
can be given on the command line or in POVRAY.INI are given in the 
reference guide.
      You may also create INI files of your own with switches or options 
similar to POVRAY.INI.  If you put a file name on the command line without 
a plus or minus sign before it, POV-Ray reads it as an INI file.  Try 
this...

POVRAY RES120 +ISHAPES +D1

      This causes POV-Ray to look for a file called RES120.INI which we 
have provided.  It sets your resolution to 120 by 90 pixels for a quick 
preview.  The following INI files have been provided for you.

   RES120.INI     Sets resolution to 120 by 90
   RES320.INI     Sets resolution to 320 by 200
   RES640.INI     Sets resolution to 640 by 480
   RES800.INI     Sets resolution to 800 by 600
   RES1K.INI      Sets resolution to 1024 by 768
   LOW.INI        Sets low quality at 120 by 90
   SLOW.INI       Turns on radiosity and anti-aliasing; very slow
                    but beautiful.
   TGAFLI.INI TGAFLC.INI   Create an FLI/FLC animation from TGA images
   PNGFLI.INI PNGFLC.INI   Create an FLI/FLC animation from PNG images
   ZIPFLI.INI ZIPFLC.INI   Create an FLI/FLC animation from zipped images
                           See "ANIMATION TIPS" below.
   ALLSCENE.INI ALLANIM.INI See "RENDERING ALL SCENES" below.

      You can create your own custom INI's which can contain any command in 
the reference guide.


ALTERNATIVES TO POVRAY.INI
--------------------------
      The POVRAY.INI file is supposed to hold your favorite global default 
options that you want to use all the time.  You should feel free to edit it 
with new options that suit your needs.  However it must be located in the 
same directory as POVRAY.EXE or it won't be found.  The dos path isn't 
searched nor will +L commands help because POVRAY.INI is processed before 
any command line switches.
      If your POVRAY.EXE resides on a CD-ROM then you can't edit the 
POVRAY.INI on the CD.  There is an alternative.  You may use an environment 
variable to specify an alternative global default.
      In your AUTOEXEC.BAT file add a line similar to this:

set POVINI=D:\DIRECT\FILE.INI

which sets the POVINI environment variable to whatever drive, directory and 
INI file you choose.  If you specify any POVINI environment variable then 
POVRAY.INI is NOT READ.  This is true even if the file you named doesn't 
exist.  Note that you are specifying an entire path and file name.  This is 
not a pointer to a directory containing POVRAY.INI.  It is a pointer to the 
actual file itself.
      Note that the POVRAYOPT environment variable in early versions of 
POV-Ray is no longer supported.


USING BATCH FILES
-----------------
      We've already described how the file RUNPOV.BAT can be used as an 
alternative to running POV-Ray directly.  RUNPOV.BAT also has one other 
use.  It uses the +GI switch to create a file called RERUN.INI.  This makes 
it very easy to run the same file over again with the same parameters.  
When creating your own scene files you will probably make dozens of test 
renders.  This is a very valuable feature.  Here is how it works...  
Suppose you render a scene as follows:

RUNPOV +IMYSCENE +D1 RES120

This renders MYSCENE.POV at 120 by 90 resolution.  (Note there is no such 
scene.  This is hypothetical.)  After viewing it, you noticed a mistake 
which you fixed with your text editor.  To rerun the scene type:

RERUNPOV

and that's all.  It will rerun the same scene you just ran.  Suppose you 
want more detail on the next run.  You can add more switches or INI files.  
For example:

RERUNPOV RES320

will rerun at higher resolution.  Subsequent uses of RERUNPOV will be at 
320 by 200 until you tell it differently.  As another example, the +A 
switch turns on anti-aliasing.  Typing "RERUNPOV +A" reruns with anti-
aliasing on.  All subsequent reruns will have it on until you do a 
"RERUNPOV -A" to turn it off. Note if you do another "RUNPOV" it starts 
over from your POVRAY.INI defaults and it overwrites the old RERUN.INI.
      One other batch file is included.  The file T2G.BAT invokes the 
TGA2GIF.EXE program for converting TGA files to GIF files.  You could 
run TGA2GIF directly but its default parameters do not generally produce 
the best results.  If you use T2G instead, it adds some command line 
switches which work better.  For a full list of switches available for 
TGA2GIF, type "TGA2GIF" with no parameters and it will display the 
available switches and options.


DISPLAY TYPES
-------------
      You have already seen how to turn on graphics preview using +D1.  
Here are details on other variations of the +D switch.  Use -D to turn the 
display off.  If you use -D then you will probably want to add the +V 
switch to turn on "v"erbose status messages so you can monitor the progress 
of the rendering while in progress.
      The number "1" after the +D tells it what kind of video hardware to 
use.  If you use +D alone or +D0 then POV-Ray will attempt to auto detect 
your hardware type.  Use +D? to see a message about what type of hardware 
POV-Ray found.
      You may also explicitly tell POV-Ray what hardware to use.  The 
following chart lists all of the supported types.  

    +D0     Auto detect (S)VGA type (Default)
    +D1     Standard VGA 320x200
    +D2     Standard VGA 360 x 480
    +D3     Tseng Labs 3000 SVGA 640x480
    +D4     Tseng Labs 4000 SVGA 
    +D5     AT&T VDC600 SVGA 640x400
    +D6     Oak Technologies SVGA 640x480
    +D7     Video 7 SVGA 640x480
    +D8     Video 7 Vega (Cirrus) VGA 360x480
    +D9     Paradise SVGA 640x480
    +DA     Ahead Systems Ver. A SVGA 640x480
    +DB     Ahead Systems Ver. B SVGA 640x480
    +DC     Chips & Technologies SVGA 640x480
    +DD     ATI SGVA (older version) 640x480
    +DE     Everex SVGA 640x480
    +DF     Trident SVGA 640x480
    +DG     VESA Standard SVGA Adapter
    +DH     ATI XL display card
    +DI     Diamond Computer Systems SpeedSTAR 24X

      The most common type is a VESA standard card which uses +DG.  VESA is 
a standard software interface that works on a wide variety of cards.  Those 
cards which do not have VESA support directly built-in, generally have a 
video driver that you can load to provide VESA support.  The program 
UniVBE is a high quality universal VESA driver that may work for you.
It can be found at www.povray.org or possibly other POV-Ray sites.
      The options listed above had been tested and worked under earlier 
versions of POV-Ray but there have been many changes in the program and we 
cannot guarantee these all still work.  If you can use VESA then do so.  It 
has been well tested and will give you the most flexibility.
      After the +D and the type, you may specify a 3rd character that 
specifies the palette type.

    +D?3 Use 332 palette with dithering (Default and best for VGA systems)
         This is a fixed palette of 256 colors with each color consisting
         3-bits of red data, 3-bits green and 2-bits blue.

    +D?0 Use HSV palette option for VGA display
         This is a fixed palette of 256 colors where colors are matched
         according to hue, saturation and intensity rather than the amount
         of red, green and blue.

    +D?G Use fixed gray scale palette option for VGA display

    +D?H Use HiColor option.  Displays 32,000+ colors with dithering. 
         Supported on VESA, SpeedSTAR 24X, ATI XL HiColor and Tseng 4000
         based cards with high color 15 or 16 bit options.

    +D?T For Truecolor 24 bit cards. Use 24 bit color.
         Supported on the Diamond SpeedSTAR 24X and cards with 
         24bit VESA support only.

Here are some examples:

    +D0H Auto detect the VGA display type and display the image to the
         screen as it's being worked on. Use the 15-bit HiColor chip and
         dithering to display more than 32,000 colors on screen. 
    +D4  Display to a TSENG 4000 chipset VGA using the 332 palette option.
    +D4H Display to a TSENG 4000 chipset VGA using the HiColor option.
    +DG0 Display to a VESA VGA adapter and use the HSV palette option.
    +DG3 Display to a VESA VGA adapter and use the 332 palette option.
    +DGH Display to a VESA VGA adapter and use the HiColor option for
         over 32,000 colors.
    +DGT Display to a VESA VGA adapter and use the TrueColor option for 
         over 16 million colors.

Note that your VESA BIOS must support these options in order for you to use 
them.  Some cards may support HiColor and/or TrueColor at the hardware 
level but not thru their VESA BIOS.


ANIMATION TIPS
--------------
      The section above on USING INI FILES lists six files for creating 
animations.  The FLI versions create 320 x 200 FLI files and the FLC 
versions create FLC files at whatever resolution you specify.  These files 
use POV-Ray's new command shell-out feature which allows you to execute a 
dos command before or after any render or before or after each frame.  Full 
details on these commands are in the reference guide.  They also require 
DTA.EXE which is not included in this package but is available at 
www.povray.org and many other places.  If you have DTA, try this example:

RUNPOV +D1 +IFLOAT1 +L\POVRAY31\SCENES\ANIMATE\FLOAT1 TGAFLI RES320 +KFF10

      The +KFF10 command tells POV-Ray to render a 10 frame animation.  
TGAFLI firsts looks to see if FLOAT1.FLI exists.  It uses a handy program 
called EXISTS.EXE which we have provided.  (Note if you are using 
installation plan 2, you must also copy EXISTS.EXE to a directory on your 
path.  It is a very small program and not worth creating a batch file.)
      You may interrupt and restart this rendering using RERUNPOV and it 
will pick up where it left off.  When finished, it calls DTA to assemble 
MYSCENE.FLI from the TGA files.
      Because lots of TGA files take up space, you may choose to use PNG 
which is a compressed file format.  PNGFLI.INI is provided for such 
rendering.  Note versions of DTA prior to 2.2 beta 24 did not properly 
handle PNG or did not support PNG at all.
      Finally if you have the utility PKZIP.EXE (not included) you can use 
the file ZIPFLI.INI to zip your TGA or PNG files together and create a FLI 
from it.  The zip method is more efficient to use if you are going to have 
to interrupt and restart rendering.  This is because files are moved to the 
archive only when 100% complete.  This let's you test to see if a frame is 
complete without re-parsing the scene.


RENDERING ALL SCENES
--------------------
      A set of batch and INI files have been provided to help you render
all of the sample scenes and animations.  These files must be run in
your C:\POVRAY31 directory or whatever directory in which you installed
POV-Ray.  The file ALLSTILL.BAT renders all still scenes using parameters
from ALLSTILL.INI.  It creates a \POVRAY31\ALLSCENE directory and puts
all the resulting GIF files there.  ALLANIM.BAT creates animations
in that same directory.  It assumes that you have the utilities pkzip.exe 
and dta.exe available in your installation directory or via your dos path.
ALLANIM.INI contains the parameters for the animations.  You may edit
these INI files to suit your taste.
