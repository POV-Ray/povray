                   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR MS-Dos


This file describes how to run the installation program for POV-Ray for 
MS-Dos.  It is not the full documentation for the program.

These procedures assume you have a basic knowledge of how to work with 
directories and files under dos.  It assumes you know what the dos path is 
and how to edit your autoexec.bat file to change the path.  The install
program will offer to do it for you but if something goes wrong you may
need to change it yourself.  If you do not have knowledge about directories, 
paths, batch files or editors, your local bookstore has many tutorial books 
available that will help you.  Don't be intimidated by the insulting titles 
of such books.  The only true "dummies" are those who give up trying.

If you have obtained this program on CD-ROM, it may already be set up so 
you can run it directly from the CD-ROM.  These instructions assume that 
you will be installing the full package on your hard drive and not running 
it directly from the CD-ROM.  

You should have obtained this file from a self-extracting archive called
POVMSDOS.EXE or something very similar.  If you followed its banner 
instructions, you created a temporary directory and ran the self-extraction
there.  It should have created at least the following files:

 POVMSDOS.ZIP  INSTALL.DOC  INSTALL.EXE  INSTALL.001  EXTERNAL.LNG
 FILE_ID.DIZ

If any of these files are missing, you have received an incomplete package.  
Please notify the place where you obtained this package that distribution 
of an incomplete package is a violation of our license in the file 
POVLEGAL.DOC and makes them subject to litigation.

If it created other files, that's probably no problem.

Type the word INSTALL and press [ENTER].  This will run the program
INSTALL.EXE which will ask you for the drive and directory where POV-Ray
is actually to be installed.  It will decompress the compressed files.  
It will offer to update your path in your autoexec.bat for you.
You will have to re-boot your computer so the new path will take effect.
If you do not want POV-Ray installed in your path then you have other
options which are described in POVMSDOS.DOC which will appear in the
installed directory.

When installation is complete, please read POVMSDOS.DOC to learn how to
run your first sample scene.  The file includes important information about 
POV-Ray that is specific to the MS-Dos version of POV-Ray.  It will 
explain display options, how to use the sample batch files, how to use 
other utilities with POV-Ray and other interesting information.

If the sample scenes work with no problem, you may delete the all of the 
files in this temporary directory.  Specifically these files are no longer 
needed:

 POVMSDOS.ZIP  INSTALL.DOC  INSTALL.EXE  INSTALL.001  EXTERNAL.LNG
 FILE_ID.DIZ

You should probably keep POVMSDOS.EXE around in case you ever need to 
re-install the program.
