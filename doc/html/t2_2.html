<h2>2.2 Getting Started</h2>
<p>The beginning tutorial explains step by step how to use POV-Ray's
scene description language to create your own scenes. The use of almost every
feature of POV-Ray's language is explained in detail. We will learn basic
things like placing cameras and light sources. We will also learn how to
create a large variety of objects and how to assign different textures to
them. The more sophisticated features like <a href="r3_4.html#r3_4_3_3_2">radiosity</a>,
<a href="r3_7.html#r3_7_2_1">interior</a>, <a href="r3_7.html#r3_7_2">media</a> and <a href="r3_7.html#r3_7_1_1">atmospheric effects</a> will be explained in detail.</p>

<div class="content-level-h3" contains="Our First Image" id="t2_2_1">
<h3>2.2.1 Our First Image</h3>
<p>We will create the scene file for a simple picture. Since ray-tracers
thrive on spheres, that is what we will render first.</p>

<div class="content-level-h4" contains="Understanding POV-Ray's Coordinate System" id="t2_2_1_1">
<h4>2.2.1.1 Understanding POV-Ray's Coordinate System</h4>
<p>First, we have to tell POV-Ray where our camera is and where it is looking. To do this, we use 3D coordinates. The usual coordinate system for POV-Ray has the positive y-axis pointing up, the positive x-axis pointing to the right, and the positive z-axis pointing into the screen as follows:</p>
<table class="centered" width="700px" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="10">
<tr>
  <td>
    <p class="tabletext">This kind of coordinate system is called a left-handed coordinate system. If we use our left hand's fingers we can easily see why it is called left-handed. We just point our thumb in the direction of the positive x-axis (to the right), the index finger in the direction of the positive y-axis (straight up) and the middle finger in the positive z-axis direction (forward). We can only do this with our left hand. If we had used our right hand we would not have been able to point the middle finger in the correct direction.</p>

  <td>
    <img class="leftpanel" width="220px" src="images/d/db/TutImgAerobics.png">
  </td>
  <td>
    <p class="tabletext">The left hand can also be used to determine rotation directions. To do this we must perform the famous <em>Computer Graphics Aerobics</em> exercise. We hold up our left hand and point our thumb in the positive direction of the axis of rotation. Our fingers will curl in the positive direction of rotation. Similarly if we point our thumb in the negative direction of the axis our fingers will curl in the negative direction of rotation.</p>
<p class="tabletext">In this illustration, the left hand is curling around the x-axis. The thumb points in the positive x direction and the fingers curl over in the positive rotation direction.</p>

</table>
<p>When a right-handed system is used, as some CAD systems and modelers do, the <code>right</code> vector in the camera specification will need to be changed, additionally be sure to use the right hand for the <em>Aerobics</em> exercise. This pertains to <em>both</em> the coordinate system and rotations. See the detailed description in <a href="r3_4.html#r3_4_2_1_7">handedness</a> for more information.</p>
<p>There is some controversy over whether POV-Ray's method of doing a right-handed system is really proper. To avoid problems we stick with the left-handed system which is not in dispute.</p>

<div class="content-level-h4" contains="Adding Standard Include Files" id="t2_2_1_2">
<h4>2.2.1.2 Adding Standard Include Files</h4>
<p>Using our personal favorite text editor, we create a file called <code>demo.pov</code>.
Some versions of POV-Ray come with their own built-in text editor which may be easier
to use. We then type in the following text. The input is case sensitive, so we have to be
sure to get capital and lowercase letters correct.</p>
<pre>
  #include &quot;colors.inc&quot;    // The include files contain
  #include &quot;stones.inc&quot;    // pre-defined scene elements
</pre>

<p>The first include statement reads in definitions for various useful
colors. The second include statement reads in a collection of stone textures.
POV-Ray comes with many standard include files. Others of interest are:</p>
<pre>
  #include &quot;textures.inc&quot;    // pre-defined scene elements
  #include &quot;shapes.inc&quot;
  #include &quot;glass.inc&quot;
  #include &quot;metals.inc&quot;
  #include &quot;woods.inc&quot;
</pre>

<p>They read pre-defined textures, shapes, glass, metal, and wood textures.
It is a good idea to have a look through them to see a few of the many
possible shapes and textures available.</p>
<p>We should only include files we really need in our scene. Some of the
include files coming with POV-Ray are quite large and we should better save
the parsing time and memory if we do not need them. In the following
examples we will only use the <code>colors.inc</code>, and <code>stones.inc</code>
include files.</p>
<p>We may have as many include files as needed in a scene file. Include files
may themselves contain include files, but we are limited to declaring
includes nested only ten levels deep.</p>
<p>Filenames specified in the include statements will be searched for in the current directory first. If it fails to find your .Inc files in the current directory, POV-Ray searches any <a href="r3_2.html#r3_2_5_3">library paths</a> that you have specified. Library paths are options set by the <code>+L</code> <a href="t2_2.html#t2_2_8_1">command-line switch</a> or <code><a href="r3_2.html#r3_2_5_3">Library_Path</a></code> option. See the chapter <a href="t2_2.html#t2_2_8">Setting POV-Ray Options</a> for more information on library paths.</p>
<p>Because it is more useful to keep include files in a separate directory, standard installations of POV-Ray place these files in the <code>c:\povray3\include</code> directory (replace <code>c:\povray3</code> with the actual directory that you installed POV-Ray in). If you get an error message saying that POV-Ray cannot open <em>colors.inc</em> or other include files, make sure that you specify the library path properly.</p>

</div>
<a name="t2_2_1_3"></a>
<div class="content-level-h4" contains="Adding a Camera" id="t2_2_1_3">
<h4>2.2.1.3 Adding a Camera</h4>
<p>The <code>camera</code> statement describes where and how the camera sees
the scene. It gives x-, y- and z-coordinates to indicate the position of the
camera and what part of the scene it is pointing at. We describe the
coordinates using a three-part <em>vector</em>. A vector is specified by
putting three numeric values between a pair of angle brackets and separating
the values with commas. We add the following camera statement to the
scene.</p>
<pre>
  camera {
    location &lt;0, 2, -3&gt;
    look_at  &lt;0, 1,  2&gt;
  }
</pre>

<p>Briefly, <code>location &lt;0,2,-3&gt;</code> places the camera up two
units and back three units from the center of the ray-tracing universe which
is at &lt;0,0,0&gt;. By default +z is into the screen and -z is back out of
the screen.</p>
<p>
Also <code>look_at &lt;0,1,2&gt;</code> rotates the camera to point at the
coordinates &lt;0,1,2&gt;. A point 1 unit up from the origin and 2 units away
from the origin. This makes it 5 units in front of and 1 unit lower than the
camera. The <code>look_at</code> point should be the center of attention of
our image.</p>
</div>
<a name="t2_2_1_4"></a>
<div class="content-level-h4" contains="Describing an Object" id="t2_2_1_4">
<h4>2.2.1.4 Describing an Object</h4>
<p>Now that the camera is set up to record the scene, let's place a
yellow sphere into the scene. We add the following to our scene file:</p>
<pre>
  sphere {
    &lt;0, 1, 2&gt;, 2
    texture {
      pigment { color Yellow }
    }
  }
</pre>

<p>The first vector specifies the center of the sphere. In this example the x
coordinate is zero so it is centered left and right. It is also at y=1 or one
unit up from the origin. The z coordinate is 2 which is five units in front
of the camera, which is at z=-3. After the center vector is a comma followed
by the radius which in this case is two units. Since the radius is half the
width of a sphere, the sphere is four units wide.</p>
</div>
<a name="t2_2_1_5"></a>
<div class="content-level-h4" contains="Adding Texture to an Object" id="t2_2_1_5">
<h4>2.2.1.5 Adding Texture to an Object</h4>
<p>After we have defined the location and size of the sphere, we need to
describe the appearance of the surface. The <code>texture</code> statement
specifies these parameters. Texture blocks describe the color, bumpiness and
finish properties of an object. In this example we will specify the color
only. This is the minimum we must do. All other texture options except color
will use default values.</p>
<p>
The color we define is the way we want an object to look if fully
illuminated. If we were painting a picture of a sphere we would use dark
shades of a color to indicate the shadowed side and bright shades on the
illuminated side. However ray-tracing takes care of that for you. We only
need to pick the basic color inherent in the object and POV-Ray brightens or
darkens it depending on the lighting in the scene. Because we are defining
the basic color the object actually <strong> has</strong> rather than how it
<strong>looks</strong> the parameter is called <code>pigment</code>.</p>
<p>
Many types of color patterns are available for use in a pigment statement.
The keyword <code>color</code> specifies that the whole object is to be one
solid color rather than some pattern of colors. We can use one of the color
identifiers previously defined in the standard include file <code>
colors.inc</code>.</p>
<p>
If no standard color is available for our needs, we may define our own color by using the <a href="r3_3.html#r3_3_1_7">color</a> keyword followed by <code>red</code>, <code>green</code> and <code> blue</code> keywords specifying the amount of red, green and blue to be mixed. For example a nice shade of pink can be specified by:</p>
<pre>
  color red 1.0 green 0.8 blue 0.8
</pre>

<p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> The international, rather than American, form &quot;colour&quot;
is also acceptable and may be used anywhere that &quot;color&quot; may be used.</p>

<p>The values after each keyword should be in the range from 0.0 to 1.0. Any
of the three components not specified will default to 0. A shortcut notation
may also be used. The following produces the same shade of pink:</p>
<pre>
  color rgb &lt;1.0, 0.8, 0.8&gt;
</pre>
<p> In many cases the <code>color</code> keyword is superfluous, so the shortest way to
specify the pink color is:</p>
<pre>
  rgb &lt;1.0, 0.8, 0.8&gt;
</pre>

<p>Colors are explained in more detail in section <a href="r3_3.html#r3_3_1_7">Color Expressions</a>.</p>

</div>
<a name="t2_2_1_6"></a>
<div class="content-level-h4" contains="Defining a Light Source" id="t2_2_1_6">
<h4>2.2.1.6 Defining a Light Source</h4>
<p>One more detail is needed for our scene. We need a light source. Until we
create one, there is no light in this virtual world. Thus we add the line</p>
<pre>
  light_source { &lt;2, 4, -3&gt; color White}
</pre>

<p>to the scene file to get our first complete POV-Ray scene file as shown
below.</p>
<pre>
  #include &quot;colors.inc&quot;
  background { color Cyan }
  camera {
    location &lt;0, 2, -3&gt;
    look_at  &lt;0, 1,  2&gt;
  }
  sphere {
    &lt;0, 1, 2&gt;, 2
    texture {
      pigment { color Yellow }
    }
  }
  light_source { &lt;2, 4, -3&gt; color White}
</pre>

<p>The vector in the <code>light_source</code> statement specifies the
location of the light as two units to our right, four units above the origin
and three units back from the origin. The light source is an invisible tiny
point that emits light. It has no physical shape, so no texture is
needed.</p>
<p>That's it! We close the file and render a small picture of it using
whatever methods you used for your particular platform. If you specified a
preview display it will appear on your screen. If you specified an output
file (the default is file output on), then POV-Ray also created a file.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you do not have high color or true color display hardware then the
preview image may look poor but the full detail is written to the image file
regardless of the type of display.</p>
<p>The scene we just traced is not quite state of the art but we will have
to start with the basics before we soon get to much more fascinating features
and scenes.</p>
</div>
<a name="t2_2_2"></a>
<div class="content-level-h3" contains="Basic Shapes" id="t2_2_2">
<h3>2.2.2 Basic Shapes</h3>
<p>So far we have just used the sphere shape. There are many other types of
shapes that can be rendered by POV-Ray. The following sections will describe
how to use some of the more simple objects as a replacement for the sphere
used above.</p>
</div>
<a name="t2_2_2_1"></a>
<div class="content-level-h4" contains="Box Object" id="t2_2_2_1">
<h4>2.2.2.1 Box Object</h4>
<p>The <code>box</code> is one of the most common objects used. We try this
example in place of the sphere:</p>
<pre>
  box {
    &lt;-1, 0,   -1&gt;,  // Near lower left corner
    &lt; 1, 0.5,  3&gt;   // Far upper right corner
    texture {
      T_Stone25     // Pre-defined from stones.inc
      scale 4       // Scale by the same amount in all
                    // directions
    }
    rotate y*20     // Equivalent to &quot;rotate &lt;0,20,0&gt;&quot;
  }
</pre>

<p>In the example we can see that a box is defined by specifying the 3D
coordinates of its opposite corners. The first vector is generally the
minimum x-, y- and z-coordinates and the 2nd vector should be the maximum x-,
y- and z-values however any two opposite corners may be used. Box objects can
only be defined parallel to the axes of the world coordinate system. We can
later rotate them to any angle. </p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> We can perform simple math on
values and vectors. In the rotate parameter we multiplied the vector
identifier <code>y</code> by 20. This is the same as &lt;0,1,0&gt;*20 or
&lt;0,20,0&gt;.</p>
</div>
<a name="t2_2_2_2"></a>
<div class="content-level-h4" contains="Cone Object" id="t2_2_2_2">
<h4>2.2.2.2 Cone Object</h4>
<p>Here is another example showing how to use a <code>cone</code>:</p>
<pre>
  cone {
    &lt;0, 1, 0&gt;, 0.3    // Center and radius of one end
    &lt;1, 2, 3&gt;, 1.0    // Center and radius of other end
    texture { T_Stone25 scale 4 }
  }
</pre>

<p>The cone shape is defined by the center and radius of each end. In this
example one end is at location &lt;0,1,0&gt; and has a radius of 0.3 while
the other end is centered at &lt;1,2,3&gt; with a radius of 1. If we want the
cone to come to a sharp point we must use radius=0. The solid end caps are
parallel to each other and perpendicular to the cone axis. If we want an open
cone with no end caps we have to add the keyword <code>open</code> after the
2nd radius like this:</p>
<pre>
  cone {
    &lt;0, 1, 0&gt;, 0.3    // Center and radius of one end
    &lt;1, 2, 3&gt;, 1.0    // Center and radius of other end
    open              // Removes end caps
    texture { T_Stone25 scale 4 }
  }

<h4>2.2.2.3 Cylinder Object</h4>

    &lt;1, 2, 3&gt;,     // Center of other end

<div class="content-level-h4" contains="Plane Object" id="t2_2_2_4">
<h4>2.2.2.4 Plane Object</h4>
<p>Let's try out a computer graphics standard <em>The Checkered
Floor.</em> We add the following object to the first version of the
<code>demo.pov</code> file, the one including the sphere.</p>
<pre>
  plane { &lt;0, 1, 0&gt;, -1
    pigment {
      checker color Red, color Blue
    }
  }
</pre>

<p>The object defined here is an infinite plane. The vector &lt;0,1,0&gt; is
the surface normal of the plane (i.e. if we were standing on the surface, the
normal points straight up). The number afterward is the distance that the
plane is displaced along the normal from the origin -- in this case, the
floor is placed at y=-1 so that the sphere at y=1, radius=2, is resting on
it.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> Even though there is no <code>texture</code> statement there is
an implied texture here. We might find that continually typing statements
that are nested like <code>texture {pigment</code>} can get to be tiresome so
POV-Ray let's us leave out the <code> texture</code> statement under many
circumstances. In general we only need the texture block surrounding a
texture identifier (like the <code> T_Stone25</code> example above), or when
creating layered textures (which are covered later).</p>
<p>
This pigment uses the checker color pattern and specifies that the two
colors red and blue should be used.</p>
<p>
Because the vectors &lt;1,0,0&gt;, &lt;0,1,0&gt; and &lt;0,0,1&gt; are used
frequently, POV-Ray has three built-in vector identifiers <code> x</code>,
<code> y</code> and <code>z</code> respectively that can be used as a
shorthand. Thus the plane could be defined as:</p>
<pre>
  plane { y, -1
    pigment { ... }
  }
</pre>

<p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> We do not use angle brackets around vector identifiers.</p>

<p> Looking at the floor, we notice that the ball casts a shadow on the
floor. Shadows are calculated very accurately by the ray-tracer, which
creates precise, sharp shadows. In the real world, penumbral or
soft shadows are often seen. Later we will learn how to use
<a href="r3_4.html#r3_4_3_1_5">extended light sources</a> to soften the shadows.</p>

<div class="content-level-h4" contains="Torus Object" id="t2_2_2_5">
<h4>2.2.2.5 Torus Object</h4>
<p>A <code>torus</code> can be thought of as a donut or an inner-tube. It is
a shape that is vastly useful in many kinds of CSG so POV-Ray has adopted
this 4th order quartic polynomial as a primitive shape. The syntax for a
torus is so simple that it makes it a very easy shape to work with once we
learn what the two float values mean. Instead of a lecture on the subject,
let's create one and do some experiments with it.</p>
<p>
We create a file called <code>tordemo.pov</code> and edit it as follows:</p>
<pre>
  #include &quot;colors.inc&quot;
  camera {
    location &lt;0, .1, -25&gt;
    look_at 0
    angle 30
  }
  background { color Gray50 } // to make the torus easy to see
  light_source { &lt;300, 300, -1000&gt; White }
  torus {
    4, 1              // major and minor radius
    rotate -90*x      // so we can see it from the top
    pigment { Green }
  }
</pre>

<p>We trace the scene. Well, it is a donut alright. Let's try changing
the major and minor radius values and see what happens. We change them as
follows:</p>
<pre>
  torus { 5, .25      // major and minor radius
</pre>

<p>That looks more like a hula-hoop! Let's try this:</p>
<pre>
  torus { 3.5, 2.5    // major and minor radius
</pre>

<p>Whoa! A donut with a serious weight problem!</p>
<p>
With such a simple syntax, there is not much else we can do to a torus
besides change its texture... or is there? Let's see...</p>
<p>
Tori are very useful objects in CSG. Let's try a little experiment. We
make a difference of a torus and a box:</p>
<pre>
  difference {
    torus {
      4, 1
      rotate x*-90  // so we can see it from the top
    }
    box { &lt;-5, -5, -1&gt;, &lt;5, 0, 1&gt; }
    pigment { Green }
  }
</pre>

<p>Interesting... a half-torus. Now we add another one flipped the other way.
Only, let's declare the original half-torus and the necessary
transformations so we can use them again:</p>
<pre>
  #declare Half_Torus = difference {
    torus {
      4, 1
      rotate -90*x  // so we can see it from the top
    }
    box { &lt;-5, -5, -1&gt;, &lt;5, 0, 1&gt; }
    pigment { Green }
  }
  #declare Flip_It_Over = 180*x;
  #declare Torus_Translate = 8;  // twice the major radius
</pre>

<p>Now we create a union of two <code>Half_Torus</code> objects:</p>
<pre>
  union {
    object { Half_Torus }
    object { Half_Torus
      rotate Flip_It_Over
      translate Torus_Translate*x
    }
  }
</pre>

<p>This makes an S-shaped object, but we cannot see the whole thing from
our present camera. Let's add a few more links, three in each direction,
move the object along the +z-direction and rotate it about the +y-axis so we
can see more of it. We also notice that there appears to be a small gap where
the half Tori meet. This is due to the fact that we are viewing this scene
from directly on the x-z-plane. We will change the camera's y-coordinate
from 0 to 0.1 to eliminate this.</p>
<pre>
  union {
    object { Half_Torus }
    object { Half_Torus
      rotate Flip_It_Over
      translate x*Torus_Translate
    }
    object { Half_Torus
      translate x*Torus_Translate*2
    }
    object { Half_Torus
      rotate Flip_It_Over
      translate x*Torus_Translate*3
    }
    object { Half_Torus
      rotate Flip_It_Over
      translate -x*Torus_Translate
    }
    object { Half_Torus
      translate -x*Torus_Translate*2
    }
    object { Half_Torus
      rotate Flip_It_Over
      translate -x*Torus_Translate*3
    }
    object { Half_Torus
      translate -x*Torus_Translate*4
    }
    rotate y*45
    translate z*20
  }
</pre>

<p>Rendering this we see a cool, undulating, snake-like something-or-other.
Neato. But we want to model something useful, something that we might see in
real life. How about a chain?</p>
<p>
Thinking about it for a moment, we realize that a single link of a chain can
be easily modeled using two half tori and two cylinders. We create a new
file. We can use the same camera, background, light source and declared
objects and transformations as we used in <code> tordemo.pov</code>:</p>
<pre>
  #include &quot;colors.inc&quot;
  camera {
    location &lt;0, .1, -25&gt;
    look_at 0
    angle 30
  }
  background { color Gray50 }
  light_source{ &lt;300, 300, -1000&gt; White }
  #declare Half_Torus = difference {
    torus {
      4,1
      sturm
      rotate x*-90  // so we can see it from the top
    }
    box { &lt;-5, -5, -1&gt;, &lt;5, 0, 1&gt; }
    pigment { Green }
  }
  #declare Flip_It_Over = x*180;
  #declare Torus_Translate = 8;
</pre>

<p>Now, we make a complete torus of two half tori:</p>
<pre>
  union {
    object { Half_Torus }
    object { Half_Torus rotate Flip_It_Over }
  }
</pre>

<p>This may seem like a wasteful way to make a complete torus, but we are
really going to move each half apart to make room for the cylinders. First,
we add the declared cylinder before the union:</p>
<pre>
  #declare Chain_Segment = cylinder {
    &lt;0, 4, 0&gt;, &lt;0, -4, 0&gt;, 1
    pigment { Green }
  }
</pre>

<p>We then add two <code>Chain_Segments</code> to the union and translate
them so that they line up with the minor radius of the torus on each
side:</p>
<pre>
  union {
    object { Half_Torus }
    object { Half_Torus rotate Flip_It_Over }
    object { Chain_Segment translate  x*Torus_Translate/2 }
    object { Chain_Segment translate -x*Torus_Translate/2 }
  }
</pre>

<p>Now we translate the two half tori +y and -y so that the clipped ends meet
the ends of the cylinders. This distance is equal to half of the previously
declared <code>Torus_Translate</code>:</p>
<pre>
  union {
    object {
      Half_Torus
      translate y*Torus_Translate/2
    }
    object {
      Half_Torus
      rotate Flip_It_Over
      translate -y*Torus_Translate/2
    }
    object {
      Chain_Segment
      translate x*Torus_Translate/2
    }
    object {
      Chain_Segment
      translate -x*Torus_Translate/2
    }
  }
</pre>

<p>We render this and voila! A single link of a chain. But we are not done
yet! Whoever heard of a green chain? We would rather use a nice metallic
color instead. First, we remove any pigment blocks in the declared tori and
cylinders. Then we add a declaration for a golden texture just before the
union that creates the link.  Finally, we add the texture to the union and
declare it as a single link:</p>
  <pre>
  #declare Half_Torus = difference {
    torus {
      4,1
      sturm
      rotate x*-90  // so we can see it from the top
    }
    box { &lt;-5, -5, -1&gt;, &lt;5, 0, 1&gt; }
  }
    
  #declare Chain_Segment = cylinder {
    &lt;0, 4, 0&gt;, &lt;0, -4, 0&gt;, 1
  }

  #declare Chain_Gold = texture {
    pigment { BrightGold }
    finish {
      ambient .1
      diffuse .4
      reflection .25
      specular 1
      metallic
    }
  }

  #declare Link = union {
    object {
      Half_Torus
      translate y*Torus_Translate/2
    }
    object {
      Half_Torus
      rotate Flip_It_Over
      translate -y*Torus_Translate/2
    }
    object {
      Chain_Segment
      translate x*Torus_Translate/2
    }
    object {
      Chain_Segment
      translate -x*Torus_Translate/2
    }    texture { Chain_Gold }
  }  
  </pre>

<p>Now we make a union of two links. The second one will have to be
translated +y so that its inner wall just meets the inner wall of the other
link, just like the links of a chain. This distance turns out to be double
the previously declared <code>Torus_Translate</code> minus 2 (twice the minor
radius). This can be described by the expression:</p>
<pre>
  Torus_Translate*2-2*y
</pre>

<p>We declare this expression as follows:</p>
<pre>
  #declare Link_Translate = Torus_Translate*2-2*y;
</pre>

<p>In the object block, we will use this declared value so that we can
multiply it to create other links. Now, we rotate the second link <code>
90*y</code> so that it is perpendicular to the first, just like links of a
chain. Finally, we scale the union by 1/4 so that we can see the whole
thing:</p>
<pre>
  union {
    object { Link }
    object { Link translate y*Link_Translate rotate y*90 }
    scale .25
  }
</pre>

<p>We render this and we will see a very realistic pair of links. If we want
to make an entire chain, we must declare the above union and then create
another union of this declared object. We must be sure to remove the scaling
from the declared object:</p>
<pre>
  #declare Link_Pair =
  union {
    object { Link }
    object { Link translate y*Link_Translate rotate y*90 }
  }
</pre>

<p>Now we declare our chain:</p>
<pre>
  #declare Chain = union {
    object { Link_Pair}
    object { Link_Pair translate  y*Link_Translate*2 }
    object { Link_Pair translate  y*Link_Translate*4 }
    object { Link_Pair translate  y*Link_Translate*6 }
    object { Link_Pair translate -y*Link_Translate*2 }
    object { Link_Pair translate -y*Link_Translate*4 }
    object { Link_Pair translate -y*Link_Translate*6 }
  }
</pre>

<table class="centered" width="700px" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="10">
<tr>
  <td>
    <p>And finally we create our chain with a couple of transformations to make it easier to see. These include scaling it down by a factor of 1/10, and rotating it so that we can clearly see each link:</p>
<pre>
  object { Chain scale .1 rotate &lt;0, 45, -45&gt; }
</pre>
    <p>We render this and we should see a very realistic gold chain stretched diagonally across the screen.</p>

<h3>2.2.3 CSG Objects</h3>
<p>Constructive Solid Geometry, or CSG, is a powerful tool to combine
primitive objects to create more complex objects as shown in the following
sections.</p>
</div>
<a name="t2_2_3_1"></a>
<div class="content-level-h4" contains="What is CSG?" id="t2_2_3_1">
<h4>2.2.3.1 What is CSG?</h4>
<p><em>CSG</em> stands for <em>Constructive Solid Geometry</em>. POV-Ray allows us to construct complex solids by combining primitive shapes in four different ways. In the <code><a href="r3_5.html#r3_5_1_4_2">union</a></code> statement, two or more shapes are added together. With the <code><a href="r3_5.html#r3_5_1_4_3">intersection</a></code> statement, two or more shapes are combined to make a new shape that consists of the area common to both shapes. The <code><a href="r3_5.html#r3_5_1_4_4">difference</a></code> statement, an initial shape has all subsequent shapes subtracted from it.</p>
<p>
And last but not least <code><a href="r3_5.html#r3_5_1_4_5">merge</a></code>, which is like a union where the surfaces inside the union are removed (useful in transparent CSG objects). We will deal with each of these in detail in the next few sections.</p>
<p>
CSG objects can be extremely complex. They can be deeply nested. In other words there can be unions of differences or intersections of merges or differences of intersections or even unions of intersections of differences of merges... ad infinitum. CSG objects are (almost always) finite objects and thus respond to auto-bounding and can be transformed like any other POV primitive shape.</p>

</div>
<a name="t2_2_3_2"></a>
<div class="content-level-h4" contains="CSG Union" id="t2_2_3_2">
<h4>2.2.3.2 CSG Union</h4>
<p>Let's try making a simple union. Create a file called <code>
csgdemo.pov</code> and edit it as follows:</p>
<pre>
  #include &quot;colors.inc&quot;
  camera {
    location &lt;0, 1, -10&gt;
    look_at 0
    angle 36
  }
  light_source { &lt;500, 500, -1000&gt; White }
  plane { y, -1.5
    pigment { checker Green White }
  }
</pre>

<p>Let's add two spheres each translated 0.5 units along the x-axis in
each direction. We color one blue and the other red.</p>
<pre>
  sphere { &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;, 1
    pigment { Blue }
    translate -0.5*x
  }
  sphere { &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;, 1
    pigment { Red }
    translate 0.5*x
  }
</pre>

<p>We trace this file and note the results. Now we place a union block around
the two spheres. This will create a single CSG union out of the two
objects.</p>
<pre>
  union{
    sphere { &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;, 1
      pigment { Blue }
      translate -0.5*x
    }
    sphere { &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;, 1
      pigment { Red }
      translate 0.5*x
    }
  }
</pre>

<p>We trace the file again. The union will appear no different from what each
sphere looked like on its own, but now we can give the entire union a single
texture and transform it as a whole. Let's do that now.</p>
<pre>
  union{
    sphere { &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;, 1
      translate -0.5*x
    }
    sphere { &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;, 1
      translate 0.5*x
    }
    pigment { Red }
    scale &lt;1, .25, 1&gt;
    rotate &lt;30, 0, 45&gt;
  }
</pre>

<p>We trace the file again. As we can see, the object has changed
dramatically. We experiment with different values of scale and rotate and try
some different textures.</p>
<p>
There are many advantages of assigning only one texture to a CSG object
instead of assigning the texture to each individual component. First, it is
much easier to use one texture if our CSG object has a lot of components
because changing the objects appearance involves changing only one single
texture. Second, the file parses faster because the texture has to be parsed
only once. This may be a great factor when doing large scenes or animations.
Third, using only one texture saves memory because the texture is only stored
once and referenced by all components of the CSG object. Assigning the
texture to all n components means that it is stored n times.</p>

</div>


<a name="t2_2_3_3"></a>
<div class="content-level-h4" contains="CSG Intersection" id="t2_2_3_3">
<h4>2.2.3.3 CSG Intersection</h4>
<p>Now let's use these same spheres to illustrate the <code>intersection</code> CSG
object. We change the word <code>union</code> to <code>intersection</code> and
delete the <code>scale</code> and <code>rotate</code> statements:</p>
<pre>
  intersection {
    sphere { &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;, 1
      translate -0.5*x
    }
    sphere { &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;, 1
      translate 0.5*x
    }
    pigment { Red }
  }
</pre>

<p>We trace the file and will see a lens-shaped object instead of the two
spheres. This is because an intersection consists of the area shared by both
shapes, in this case the lens-shaped area where the two spheres overlap. We
like this lens-shaped object so we will use it to demonstrate
differences.</p>

</div>
<a name="t2_2_3_4"></a>
<div class="content-level-h4" contains="CSG Difference" id="t2_2_3_4">
<h4>2.2.3.4 CSG Difference</h4>
<p>We rotate the lens-shaped intersection about the y-axis so that the broad
side is facing the camera.</p>
<pre>
  intersection{
    sphere { &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;, 1
      translate -0.5*x
    }
    sphere { &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;, 1
      translate 0.5*x
    }
    pigment { Red }
    rotate 90*y
  }
</pre>

<p>Let's create a cylinder and stick it right in the middle of the
lens.</p>
<pre>
  cylinder { &lt;0, 0, -1&gt; &lt;0, 0, 1&gt;, .35
    pigment { Blue }
  }
</pre>

<p>We render the scene to see the position of the cylinder. We will place a
<code>difference</code> block around both the lens-shaped intersection and
the cylinder like this:</p>
<pre>
  difference {
    intersection {
      sphere { &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;, 1
        translate -0.5*x
      }
      sphere { &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;, 1
        translate 0.5*x
      }
      pigment { Red }
      rotate 90*y
    }
    cylinder { &lt;0, 0, -1&gt; &lt;0, 0, 1&gt;, .35
      pigment { Blue }
    }
  }
</pre>

<p>We render the file again and see the lens-shaped intersection with a neat
hole in the middle of it where the cylinder was. The cylinder has been <code>subtracted</code>
from the intersection. Note that the pigment of the cylinder causes the surface of the hole to
be colored blue. If we eliminate this pigment the surface of the hole will be black, as this is the   default color if no color is specified.</p>
<p>
OK, let's get a little wilder now. Let's declare our perforated lens
object to give it a name. Let's also eliminate all textures in the
declared object because we will want them to be in the final union
instead.</p>
<pre>
  #declare Lens_With_Hole = difference {
    intersection {
      sphere { &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;, 1
        translate -0.5*x
      }
      sphere { &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;, 1
        translate 0.5*x
      }
      rotate 90*y
    }
    cylinder { &lt;0, 0, -1&gt; &lt;0, 0, 1&gt;, .35 }
  }
</pre>

<p>Let's use a union to build a complex shape composed of copies of this
object.</p>
<pre>
  union {
    object { Lens_With_Hole translate &lt;-.65, .65, 0&gt; }
    object { Lens_With_Hole translate &lt;.65, .65, 0&gt; }
    object { Lens_With_Hole translate &lt;-.65, -.65, 0&gt; }
    object { Lens_With_Hole translate &lt;.65, -.65, 0&gt; }
    pigment { Red }
  }
</pre>

<p>We render the scene. An interesting object to be sure. But let's try
something more. Let's make it a partially-transparent object by adding
some filter to the pigment block.</p>
<pre>
  union {
    object { Lens_With_Hole translate &lt;-.65, .65, 0&gt; }
    object { Lens_With_Hole translate &lt;.65, .65, 0&gt; }

<h5>2.2.3.6.1 Co-incident Surfaces</h5>
<p>POV-Ray uses inside/outside tests to determine the points at which a ray
intersects a CSG object. A problem arises when the surfaces of two different
shapes coincide because there is no way (due to the computer's floating-point
accuracy) to tell whether a point on the coincident surface belongs to one shape
or the other.</p>
<p>
Look at the following example where a cylinder is used to cut a hole in a
larger box.</p>
<pre>
  difference {
    box { -1, 1 pigment { Red } }
    cylinder { -z, z, 0.5 pigment { Green } }
  }
</pre>

<p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> The vectors -1 and 1 in the box definition expand to
&lt;-1,-1,-1&gt; and &lt;1,1,1&gt; respectively.</p>

<p>If we trace this object we see red speckles where the hole is supposed to
be. This is caused by the coincident surfaces of the cylinder and the box.
One time the cylinder's surface is hit first by a viewing ray, resulting
in the correct rendering of the hole, and another time the box is hit first,
leading to a wrong result where the hole vanishes and red speckles appear.
This problem can be avoided by increasing the size of the cylinder to get rid
of the coincidence surfaces. This is done by:</p>
<pre>
  difference {
    box { -1, 1 pigment { Red } }
    cylinder { -1.001*z, 1.001*z, 0.5 pigment { Green } }
  }
</pre>

<p>In general we have to make the subtracted object a little bit larger in a
CSG difference. We just have to look for coincident surfaces and increase the
subtracted object appropriately to get rid of those surfaces.</p>
<p>
The same problem occurs in CSG intersections and is also avoided by scaling
some of the involved objects.</p>

<h3>2.2.4 The Light Source</h3>
<p>In any ray-traced scene, the light needed to illuminate our objects and
their surfaces must come from a light source. There are many kinds of light
sources available in POV-Ray and careful use of the correct kind can yield
very impressive results. Let's take a moment to explore some of the
different kinds of light sources and their various parameters.</p>

</div>
<a name="t2_2_4_1"></a>
<div class="content-level-h4" contains="The Pointlight Source" id="t2_2_4_1">
<h4>2.2.4.1 The Pointlight Source</h4>
<p>Pointlights are exactly what the name indicates. A pointlight has no size,
is invisible and illuminates everything in the scene equally no matter how
far away from the light source it may be (this behavior can be changed). This
is the simplest and most basic light source. There are only two important
parameters, location and color. Let's design a simple scene and place a
pointlight source in it.</p>
<p>
We create a new file and name it <code>litedemo.pov</code>. We edit it as
follows:</p>
<pre>
  #include &quot;colors.inc&quot;
  #include &quot;textures.inc&quot;
  camera {
    location  &lt;-4, 3, -9&gt;
    look_at   &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;
    angle 48
  }
</pre>

<p>We add the following simple objects:</p>
<pre>
  plane {
    y, -1
    texture {
      pigment {
        checker
        color rgb&lt;0.5, 0, 0&gt;
        color rgb&lt;0, 0.5, 0.5&gt;
      }
      finish {
        diffuse 0.4
        ambient 0.2
        phong 1
        phong_size 100
        reflection 0.25
      }
    }
  }
  torus {
    1.5, 0.5
    texture { Brown_Agate }
    rotate &lt;90, 160, 0&gt;
    translate &lt;-1, 1, 3&gt;
  }
  box {
    &lt;-1, -1, -1&gt;, &lt;1, 1, 1&gt;
    texture { DMFLightOak }
    translate &lt;2, 0, 2.3&gt;
  }
  cone {
    &lt;0,1,0&gt;, 0, &lt;0,0,0&gt;, 1
    texture { PinkAlabaster }
    scale &lt;1, 3, 1&gt;
    translate &lt;-2, -1, -1&gt;
  }
  sphere {
    &lt;0,0,0&gt;,1
    texture { Sapphire_Agate }
    translate &lt;1.5, 0, -2&gt;
  }
</pre>

<p>Now we add a pointlight:</p>
<pre>
  light_source {
    &lt;2, 10, -3&gt;
    color White
  }
</pre>

<p>We render this and see that the objects are
clearly visible with sharp shadows. The sides of curved objects nearest the
light source are brightest in color with the areas that are facing away from
the light source being darkest. We also note that the checkered plane is
illuminated evenly all the way to the horizon. This allows us to see the
plane, but it is not very realistic.</p>

<div class="content-level-h4" contains="The Spotlight Source" id="t2_2_4_2">
<h4>2.2.4.2 The Spotlight Source</h4>
<p>Spotlights are a very useful type of light source. They can be used to add
highlights and illuminate features much as a photographer uses spots to do
the same thing. To create a spotlight simply add the <code><a href="r3_4.html#r3_4_3_1_2">spotlight</a></code>
keyword to a regular point light. There are a few more parameters with
spotlights than with pointlights. These are <code><a href="r3_4.html#r3_4_3_1_2">radius</a></code>,
<code><a href="r3_4.html#r3_4_3_1_2">falloff</a></code>, <code><a href="r3_4.html#r3_4_3_1_2">falloff</a></code> and <code><a href="r3_4.html#r3_4_3_1_2">point_at</a></code>. The <code>radius</code> parameter is the angle of the fully illuminated cone. The <code>falloff</code> parameter is the angle of the <em>umbra</em> cone where the light falls off to darkness. The <code>tightness</code> is a parameter that determines the rate of the light falloff. The <code>point_at</code> parameter is just what it says, the location where the spotlight is pointing to. Let's change the light in our scene as follows:</p>
<pre>
  light_source {
    &lt;0, 10, -3&gt;
    color White
    spotlight
    radius 15
    falloff 20
    tightness 10
    point_at &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;
  }
</pre>

<p>We render this and see that only the objects
are illuminated. The rest of the plane and the outer portions of the objects
are now unlit. There is a broad falloff area but the shadows are still razor
sharp. Let's try fiddling with some of these parameters to see what they
do. We change the falloff value to 16 (it must always be larger than the
radius value) and render again. Now the falloff is very narrow and the
objects are either brightly lit or in total darkness. Now we change falloff
back to 20 and change the tightness value to 100 (higher is tighter) and
render again. The spotlight appears to have gotten much smaller but what has
really happened is that the falloff has become so steep that the radius
actually appears smaller.</p>
<p>
We decide that a tightness value of 10 (the default) and a falloff value of
18 are best for this spotlight and we now want to put a few spots around the
scene for effect. Let's place a slightly narrower blue and a red one in
addition to the white one we already have:</p>
<pre>
  light_source {
    &lt;10, 10, -1&gt;
    color Red
    spotlight
    radius 12
    falloff 14
    tightness 10
    point_at &lt;2, 0, 0&gt;
  }
  light_source {
    &lt;-12, 10, -1&gt;
    color Blue
    spotlight
    radius 12
    falloff 14
    tightness 10
    point_at &lt;-2, 0, 0&gt;
  }
</pre>

<p>Rendering this we see that the scene now has a wonderfully mysterious air
to it. The three spotlights all converge on the objects making them blue on
one side and red on the other with enough white in the middle to provide a
balance.</p>

<a name="t2_2_4_3"></a>
<div class="content-level-h4" contains="The Cylindrical Light Source" id="t2_2_4_3">
<h4>2.2.4.3 The Cylindrical Light Source</h4>
<p>Spotlights are cone shaped, meaning that their effect will change with
distance. The farther away from the spotlight an object is, the larger the
apparent radius will be. But we may want the radius and falloff to be a
particular size no matter how far away the spotlight is. For this reason,
cylindrical light sources are needed. A cylindrical light source is just like
a spotlight, except that the radius and falloff regions are the same no
matter how far from the light source our object is. The shape is therefore a
cylinder rather than a cone. We can specify a cylindrical light source by
replacing the <code>spotlight</code> keyword with the <code>cylinder</code>
keyword. We try this now with our scene by replacing all three spotlights
with cylinder lights and rendering again. We see that the scene is much
dimmer. This is because the cylindrical constraints do not let the light
spread out like in a spotlight. Larger radius and falloff values are needed
to do the job. We try a radius of 20 and a falloff of 30 for all three
lights. That's the ticket!</p>

</div>
<a name="t2_2_4_4"></a>
<div class="content-level-h4" contains="The Area Light Source" id="t2_2_4_4">
<h4>2.2.4.4 The Area Light Source</h4>
<p>So far all of our light sources have one thing in common. They produce
sharp shadows. This is because the actual light source is a point that is
infinitely small. Objects are either in direct sight of the light, in which
case they are fully illuminated, or they are not, in which case they are
fully shaded. In real life, this kind of stark light and shadow situation
exists only in outer space where the direct light of the sun pierces the
total blackness of space. But here on Earth, light bends around objects,
bounces off objects, and usually the source has some dimension, meaning that
it can be partially hidden from sight (shadows are not sharp anymore). They
have what is known as an <em>umbra</em>, or an area of fuzziness where there
is neither total light or shade. In order to simulate these <em> soft</em>
shadows, a ray-tracer must give its light sources dimension. POV-Ray
accomplishes this with a feature known as an area light.</p>
<p>
Area lights have dimension in two axis'. These are specified by the
first two vectors in the area light syntax. We must also specify how many
lights are to be in the array. More will give us cleaner soft shadows but
will take longer to render. Usually a 3*3 or a 5*5 array will suffice. We
also have the option of specifying an adaptive value. The <code>
adaptive</code> keyword tells the ray-tracer that it can adapt to the
situation and send only the needed rays to determine the value of the pixel.
If adaptive is not used, a separate ray will be sent for every light in the
area light. This can really slow things down. The higher the adaptive value
the cleaner the umbra will be but the longer the trace will take. Usually an
adaptive value of 1 is sufficient. Finally, we probably should use the <code>
jitter</code> keyword. This tells the ray-tracer to slightly move the
position of each light in the area light so that the shadows appear truly
soft instead of giving us an umbra consisting of closely banded shadows.</p>
<p>
OK, let's try one. We comment out the cylinder lights and add the
following:</p>
<pre>
  light_source {
    &lt;2, 10, -3&gt;
    color White
    area_light &lt;5, 0, 0&gt;, &lt;0, 0, 5&gt;, 5, 5
    adaptive 1
    jitter
  }
</pre>

<p>This is a white area light centered at &lt;2,10,-3&gt;. It is 5 units
(along the x-axis) by 5 units (along the z-axis) in size and has 25 (5*5)
lights in it. We have specified adaptive 1 and jitter. We render and right away we notice two things. The trace takes quite a bit longer than it did with a point or a spotlight and the shadows are no longer sharp! They all
have nice soft umbrae around them. Wait, it gets better.</p>
<p>
Spotlights and cylinder lights can be area lights too! Remember those sharp
shadows from the spotlights in our scene? It would not make much sense to use
a 5*5 array for a spotlight, but a smaller array might do a good job of
giving us just the right amount of umbra for a spotlight. Let's try it.
We comment out the area light and change the cylinder lights so that they
read as follows:</p>
<pre>
  light_source {
    &lt;2, 10, -3&gt;
    color White
    spotlight
    radius 15
    falloff 18
    tightness 10
    area_light &lt;1, 0, 0&gt;, &lt;0, 0, 1&gt;, 2, 2
    adaptive 1
    jitter
    point_at &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;
  }
  light_source {
    &lt;10, 10, -1&gt;
    color Red
    spotlight
    radius 12
    falloff 14
    tightness 10
    area_light &lt;1, 0, 0&gt;, &lt;0, 0, 1&gt;, 2, 2
    adaptive 1
    jitter
    point_at &lt;2, 0, 0&gt;
  }
  light_source {
    &lt;-12, 10, -1&gt;
    color Blue
    spotlight
    radius 12
    falloff 14
    tightness 10
    area_light &lt;1, 0, 0&gt;, &lt;0, 0, 1&gt;, 2, 2
    adaptive 1
    jitter
    point_at &lt;-2, 0, 0&gt;
  }
</pre>

<p>We now have three area-spotlights, one unit square consisting of an array
of four (2*2) lights, three different colors, all shining on our scene. We
render this and it appears to work perfectly. All our
shadows have small, tight umbrae, just the sort we would expect to find on an
object under a real spotlight.</p>

</div>
<a name="t2_2_4_5"></a>
<div class="content-level-h4" contains="The Ambient Light Source" id="t2_2_4_5">
<h4>2.2.4.5 The Ambient Light Source</h4>
<p>The <em>ambient light source</em> is used to simulate the effect of
inter-diffuse reflection. If there was not inter-diffuse reflection all
areas not directly lit by a light source would be completely dark. POV-Ray
uses the <code>ambient</code> keyword to determine how much light coming from
the ambient light source is reflected by a surface.</p>
<p>
By default the ambient light source, which emits its light everywhere and in
all directions, is pure white (<code>rgb &lt;1,1,1&gt;</code>). Changing its
color can be used to create interesting effects. First of all the overall
light level of the scene can be adjusted easily. Instead of changing all
ambient values in every finish only the ambient light source is modified. By
assigning different colors we can create nice effects like a moody reddish
ambient lighting.</p>
<p>
Below is an example of a red ambient light source.</p>
<pre>
  global_settings { ambient_light rgb&lt;1, 0, 0&gt; }

<div class="content-level-h5" contains="Using Shadowless Lights" id="t2_2_4_6_1">
<h5>2.2.4.6.1 Using Shadowless Lights</h5>
<p>Light sources can be assigned the <code>shadowless</code> keyword and no
shadows will be cast due to its presence in a scene. Sometimes, scenes are
difficult to illuminate properly using the lights we have chosen to
illuminate our objects. It is impractical and unrealistic to apply a higher
ambient value to the texture of every object in the scene. So instead, we
would place a couple of <em>fill lights</em> around the scene. Fill lights
are simply dimmer lights with the <code>shadowless</code> keyword that act to
boost the illumination of other areas of the scene that may not be lit well.
Let's try using one in our scene.</p>
<p>
Remember the three colored area spotlights? We go back and un-comment them
and comment out any other lights we have made. Now we add the following:</p>
<pre>
  light_source {
    &lt;0, 20, 0&gt;
    color Gray50
    shadowless
  }
</pre>

<p>This is a fairly dim light 20 units over the center of the scene. It will
give a dim illumination to all objects including the plane in the background.
We render it and see.</p>

<div class="content-level-h5" contains="Assigning an Object to a Light Source" id="t2_2_4_6_2">
<h5>2.2.4.6.2 Assigning an Object to a Light Source</h5>
<p>Light sources are invisible. They are just a location where the light
appears to be coming from. They have no true size or shape. If we want our
light source to be a visible shape, we can use the <code>looks_like</code>
keyword. We can specify that our light source can look like any object we
choose. When we use <code>looks_like</code>, then <code>no_shadow</code> is
applied to the object automatically. This is done so that the object will not
block any illumination from the light source. If we want some blocking to
occur (as in a lamp shade), it is better to simply use a union to do the same
thing. Let's add such an object to our scene. Here is a light bulb we
have made just for this purpose:</p>
<pre>
  #declare Lightbulb = union {
    merge {
      sphere { &lt;0,0,0&gt;,1 }
      cylinder {
        &lt;0,0,1&gt;, &lt;0,0,0&gt;, 1
        scale &lt;0.35, 0.35, 1.0&gt;
        translate  0.5*z
      }
      texture {
        pigment {color rgb &lt;1, 1, 1&gt;}
        finish {emission .8 diffuse .6}
      }
    }
    cylinder {
      &lt;0,0,1&gt;, &lt;0,0,0&gt;, 1
      scale &lt;0.4, 0.4, 0.5&gt;
      texture { Brass_Texture }
      translate  1.5*z
    }
    rotate -90*x
    scale .5
  }
</pre>

<p>Now we add the light source:</p>
<pre>
  light_source {
    &lt;0, 2, 0&gt;
    color White
    looks_like { Lightbulb }
  }
</pre>

<p>Rendering this we see that a fairly believable light bulb now illuminates
the scene. However, if we do not specify a high value for <code>emission</code>, the light bulb
is not lit by the light source. On the plus side, all of the shadows fall
away from the light bulb, just as they would in a real situation. The shadows
are sharp, so let's make our bulb an area light:</p>
<pre>
  light_source {
    &lt;0, 2, 0&gt;
    color White
    area_light &lt;1, 0, 0&gt;, &lt;0, 1, 0&gt;, 2, 2
    adaptive 1
    jitter
    looks_like { Lightbulb }
  }
</pre>

<p>We note that we have placed this area light in the x-y-plane instead of
the x-z-plane. We also note that the actual appearance of the light bulb is
not affected in any way by the light source. The bulb must be illuminated by
some other light source or by, as in this case, a high value for <code>emission</code>.</p>

<div class="content-level-h5" contains="Using Light Fading" id="t2_2_4_6_3">
<h5>2.2.4.6.3 Using Light Fading</h5>
<p>If it is realism we want, it is not realistic for the plane to be evenly
illuminated off into the distance. In real life, light gets scattered as it
travels so it diminishes its ability to illuminate objects the farther it
gets from its source. To simulate this, POV-Ray allows us to use two
keywords: <code>fade_distance</code>, which specifies the distance at which
full illumination is achieved, and <code>fade_power</code>, an exponential
value which determines the actual rate of attenuation. Let's apply these
keywords to our fill light.</p>
<p>
First, we make the fill light a little brighter by changing <code>
Gray50</code> to <code>Gray75</code>. Now we change that fill light as
follows:</p>
<pre>
  light_source {
    &lt;0, 20, 0&gt;
    color Gray75
    fade_distance 5
    fade_power 1
    shadowless
  }
</pre>

<p>This means that the full value of the fill light will be achieved at a
distance of 5 units away from the light source. The fade power of 1 means
that the falloff will be linear (the light falls off at a constant rate). We
render this to see the result.</p>
<p>
That definitely worked! Now let's try a fade power of 2 and a fade
distance of 10. Again, this works well. The falloff is much faster with a
fade power of 2 so we had to raise the fade distance to 10.</p>

<div class="content-level-h4" contains="Surface Finishes" id="t2_2_5_1">
<h4>2.2.5.1 Surface Finishes</h4>
<p>One of the main features of a ray-tracer is its ability to do interesting
things with surface finishes such as highlights and reflection. Let's add
a nice little Phong highlight (shiny spot) to a sphere. To do this we need to
add a <code>finish</code> keyword followed by a parameter. We change the
definition of the sphere to this:</p>
<pre>
  sphere {
    &lt;0, 1, 2&gt;, 2
    texture {
      pigment { color Yellow } //Yellow is pre-defined in COLORS.INC
      finish { phong 1 }
    }
  }
</pre>

<p>We render the scene. The <code><a href="r3_6.html#r3_6_1_3_4_1">phong</a></code> keyword adds a highlight the same color of the light shining on the object. It adds a lot of credibility to the picture and makes the object look smooth and shiny. Lower values of phong will make the highlight less bright (values should be between 0 and 1).</p>

<a name="t2_2_5_2"></a>
<div class="content-level-h4" contains="Adding Bumpiness" id="t2_2_5_2">
<h4>2.2.5.2 Adding Bumpiness</h4>
<p>The highlight we have added illustrates how much of our perception depends
on the reflective properties of an object. Ray-tracing can exploit this by
playing tricks on our perception to make us see complex details that
are not really there.</p>
<p>
Suppose we wanted a very bumpy surface on the object. It would be very
difficult to mathematically model lots of bumps. We can however simulate the
way bumps look by altering the way light reflects off of the surface.
Reflection calculations depend on a vector called a <em>surface normal</em>.
This is a vector which points away from the surface and is perpendicular to
it. By artificially modifying (or perturbing) this normal vector we can
simulate bumps. We change the scene to read as follows and render it:</p>
<pre>
  sphere {
    &lt;0, 1, 2&gt;, 2
    texture {
      pigment { color Yellow }
      normal { bumps 0.4 scale 0.2 }
      finish { phong 1 }
    }
  }
</pre>

<p>This tells POV-Ray to use the <code>bumps</code> pattern to modify the
surface normal. The value 0.4 controls the apparent depth of the bumps.
Usually the bumps are about 1 unit wide which does not work very well with
a sphere of radius 2. The scale makes the bumps 1/5th as wide but does not
affect their depth.</p>

<h4>2.2.5.3 Creating Color Patterns</h4>
<p>We can do more than assigning a solid color to an object. We can create
complex patterns in the pigment block like in these examples:</p>
<pre>
  sphere {
    &lt;0, 1, 2&gt;, 2
    texture {
      pigment {
        wood
        color_map {
          [0.0 color DarkTan]
          [0.9 color DarkBrown]
          [1.0 color VeryDarkBrown]
        }
        turbulence 0.05
        scale &lt;0.2, 0.3, 1&gt;
      }
      finish { phong 1 }
    }
  }

  sphere {
    &lt;0, 1, 2&gt;, 2
    texture {
      pigment {
        wood
        color_map {
          [0.0 color Red]
          [0.5 color Red]
          [0.5 color Blue]
          [1.0 color Blue]
        }
        scale &lt;0.2, 0.3, 1&gt;
      }
      finish { phong 1 }
    }
  }
</pre>

<p>The keyword <code><a href="r3_6.html#r3_6_2_1_30">wood</a></code> specifies a pigment 
<a href="r3_6.html#r3_6_2">pattern</a> of concentric rings like rings in wood.
For every position in POV-space, a pattern returns a float value in the range 
from zero to one. Values outside the zero to one range are ignored. The 
<code><a href="r3_6.html#r3_6_1_1_2">color_map</a></code> specifies what color vector
is assigned to that float value. In the first example the color of the wood blends
from <code>DarkTan</code> to <code>DarkBrown</code> over the first 90% of the vein
and from <code>DarkBrown</code> to <code>VeryDarkBrown</code> over the remaining 10%.
In the second example the colors do not blend from one to an other, but change abrupt.
The <code><a href="r3_6.html#r3_6_2_5_5_9">turbulence</a></code> keyword slightly stirs up the pattern so the veins are not perfect circles and the <code><a href="r3_3.html#r3_3_1_12_2">scale</a></code> keyword adjusts the size of the pattern.</p>
<p>
Most patterns are set up by default to give us one <em>feature</em> across
a sphere of radius 1.0. A feature is very roughly defined as a color
transition. For example, a wood texture would have one band on a sphere of
radius 1.0. In this example we scale the pattern using the <code>scale</code>
keyword followed by a vector. In this case we scaled 0.2 in the x direction,
0.3 in the y direction and the z direction is scaled by 1, which leaves it
unchanged. Scale values larger than one will stretch an element. Scale values
smaller than one will squish an element. A scale value of one will leave an
element unchanged.</p>

</div>
<a name="t2_2_5_4"></a>
<div class="content-level-h4" contains="Pre-defined Textures" id="t2_2_5_4">
<h4>2.2.5.4 Pre-defined Textures</h4>
<p>POV-Ray has some very sophisticated textures pre-defined in the standard
include files <code>glass.inc</code>, <code>metals.inc</code>, <code>stones.inc</code>
and <code>woods.inc</code>. Some are entire textures with pigment, normal and/or finish
parameters already defined. Some are just pigments or just finishes.</p>
<p>We change the definition of our sphere to the following and then re-render it:</p>
<pre>
  sphere {
    &lt;0, 1, 2&gt;, 2
    texture {
      pigment {
        DMFWood4       // pre-defined in textures.inc
        scale 4        // scale by the same amount in all
                       // directions
      }
      finish { Shiny } // pre-defined in finish.inc
    }
  }
</pre>

<p>The pigment identifier <code>DMFWood4</code> has already been scaled down
quite small when it was defined. For this example we want to scale the
pattern larger. Because we want to scale it uniformly we can put a single
value after the scale keyword rather than a vector of x, y, z scale
factors.</p>
<p>
We look through the file <code>textures.inc</code> to see what pigments and
finishes are defined and try them out. We just insert the name of the new
pigment where <code>DMFWood4</code> is now or try a different finish in place
of <code>Shiny</code> and re-render our file.</p>
<p>
Here is an example of using a complete texture identifier rather than just
the pieces.</p>
<pre>
  sphere {
    &lt;0, 1, 2&gt;, 2
    texture { PinkAlabaster }
  }

<a name="t2_2_6_1"></a>
<div class="content-level-h4" contains="Using Focal Blur" id="t2_2_6_1">
<h4>2.2.6.1 Using Focal Blur</h4>
<p>Let's construct a simple scene to illustrate the use of focal blur.
For this example we will use a pink sphere, a green box and a blue cylinder
with the sphere placed in the foreground, the box in the center and the
cylinder in the background. A checkered floor for perspective and a couple of
light sources will complete the scene. We create a new file called <code>
focaldem.pov</code> and enter the following text</p>
<pre>
  #include &quot;colors.inc&quot;
  #include &quot;shapes.inc&quot;
  #include &quot;textures.inc&quot;
  sphere {
    &lt;1, 0, -6&gt;, 0.5
    finish {
      ambient 0.1
      diffuse 0.6
    }
    pigment { NeonPink }
  }
  box {
    &lt;-1, -1, -1&gt;, &lt; 1,  1,  1&gt;
    rotate &lt;0, -20, 0&gt;
    finish {
      ambient 0.1
      diffuse 0.6
    }
    pigment { Green }
  }
  cylinder {
    &lt;-6, 6, 30&gt;, &lt;-6, -1, 30&gt;, 3
    finish {
      ambient 0.1
      diffuse 0.6
    }
    pigment {NeonBlue}
  }
  plane {
    y, -1.0
    pigment {
      checker color Gray65 color Gray30
    }
  }
  light_source { &lt;5, 30, -30&gt; color White }
  light_source { &lt;-5, 30, -30&gt; color White }
</pre>

<p>Now we can proceed to place our focal blur camera to an appropriate
viewing position. Straight back from our three objects will yield a nice
view. Adjusting the focal point will move the point of focus anywhere in the
scene. We just add the following lines to the file:</p>
<pre>
  camera {
    location &lt;0.0, 1.0, -10.0&gt;
    look_at  &lt;0.0, 1.0,  0.0&gt;
  //  focal_point &lt;-6, 1, 30&gt;    // blue cylinder in focus
  //  focal_point &lt; 0, 1,  0&gt;    // green box in focus
    focal_point &lt; 1, 1, -6&gt;    // pink sphere in focus
    aperture 0.4     // a nice compromise
  //  aperture 0.05    // almost everything is in focus
  //  aperture 1.5     // much blurring
  //  blur_samples 4       // fewer samples, faster to render
    blur_samples 20      // more samples, higher quality image
  }
</pre>

<p>The focal point is simply the point at which the focus of the camera is at
its sharpest. We position this point in our scene and assign a value to the
aperture to adjust how close or how far away we want the focal blur to occur
from the focused area.</p>
<p>
The aperture setting can be considered an <em>area of focus</em>. Opening
up the aperture has the effect of making the area of focus smaller while
giving the aperture a smaller value makes the area of focus larger. This is
how we control where focal blur begins to occur around the focal point.</p>
<p>
The blur samples setting determines how many rays are used to sample each
pixel. Basically, the more rays that are used the higher the quality of the
resultant image, but consequently the longer it takes to render. Each scene
is different so we have to experiment. This tutorial has examples of 4 and 20
samples but we can use more for high resolution images. We should not use
more samples than is necessary to achieve the desired quality - more samples
take more time to render. The confidence and variance settings are covered in
the section <a href="r3_4.html#r3_4_2_3">Focal Blur</a>.</p>
<p>
We experiment with the focal point, aperture, and blur sample settings. The
scene has lines with other values that we can try by commenting out the
default line with double slash marks and un-commenting the line we wish to
try out. We make only one change at a time to see the effect on the
scene.</p>
<p>
Two final points when tracing a scene using a focal blur camera. We
need not specify anti-aliasing because the focal blur code uses its own
sampling method that automatically takes care of anti-aliasing. Focal blur
can only be used with the perspective camera.</p>

<div class="content-level-h3" contains="POV-Ray Coordinate System" id="t2_2_7">
<h3>2.2.7 POV-Ray Coordinate System</h3>
<p>Objects, lights and the camera are positioned using a typical 3D
coordinate system. The usual coordinate system for POV-Ray has the positive
y-axis pointing up, the positive x-axis pointing to the right and the
positive z-axis pointing into the screen. The negative values of the axes
point the other direction as shown in the images in the section
<a href="t2_2.html#t2_2_1_1">Understanding POV-Ray's Coordinate System</a>.</p>
<p>
Locations within that coordinate system are usually specified by a three
component vector. The three values correspond to the x, y and z directions
respectively. For example, the vector <code>&lt;1,2,3&gt;</code> means the
point that is one unit to the right, two units up and three units in front
of the center of the universe at <code>&lt;0,0,0&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>
Vectors are not always points though. They can also refer to an amount to
size, move or rotate a scene element or to modify the texture pattern applied
to an object.</p>
<p>
The size, location, orientation, and deformation of items within the
coordinate system is controlled by modifiers called <em>transformations</em>.
The follow sub-sections describe the transformations and their usage.</p>

</div>
<a name="t2_2_7_1"></a>
<div class="content-level-h4" contains="Transformations" id="t2_2_7_1">
<h4>2.2.7.1 Transformations</h4>
<p>The supported transformations are <code>rotate</code>, <code>
scale</code>, and <code>translate</code>. They are used to turn, size and
move an object or texture. A transformation matrix may also be used to
specify complex transformations directly. Groups of transformations may be
merged together and stored in a transformation identifier. The syntax for
transformations is as follows.</p>
<pre>
TRANSFORMATION:
    rotate &lt;Rotate_Amt&gt; | scale &lt;Scale_Amt&gt; | 
    translate &lt;Translate_Amt&gt; | transform TRANSFORM_IDENTIFIER | 
    transform { TRANSFORMATION_BLOCK...} |

        Val10, Val11, Val12,
        Val20, Val21, Val22,
        Val30, Val31, Val32&gt;

<a name="t2_2_7_1_1"></a>
<div class="content-level-h5" contains="Translate" id="t2_2_7_1_1">
<h5>2.2.7.1.1 Translate</h5>
<p>Items may be moved by adding a <code>translate</code> modifier. It
consists of the keyword <code>translate</code> followed by a vector
expression. The three terms of the vector specify the number of units to move
in each of the x, y and z directions. Translate moves the element relative to
its current position. For example</p>
<pre>
 sphere { &lt;10, 10, 10&gt;, 1
  pigment { Green }
  translate &lt;-5, 2, 1&gt;
 }
</pre>

<p>will move the sphere from the location <code>&lt;10,10,10&gt;</code> to
<code>&lt;5,12,11&gt;</code>. It does not move it to the absolute location
<code>&lt;-5,2,1&gt;</code>. Translations are always relative to the
item's location before the move. Translating by zero will leave the
element unchanged on that axis. For example:</p>
<pre>
 sphere { &lt;10, 10, 10&gt;, 1
  pigment { Green }
  translate 3*x // evaluates to &lt;3,0,0&gt; so move 3 units
         // in the x direction and none along y or z
 }
</pre>

</div>
<a name="t2_2_7_1_2"></a>
<div class="content-level-h5" contains="Scale" id="t2_2_7_1_2">
<h5>2.2.7.1.2 Scale</h5>
<p>You may change the size of an object or texture pattern by adding a <code>
scale</code> modifier. It consists of the keyword <code>scale</code> followed
by a vector expression. The three terms of the vector specify the amount of
scaling in each of the x, y and z directions.</p>
<p>
Uneven scaling is used to <em> stretch</em> or <em>squish</em> an element.
Values larger than one stretch the element on that axis while values smaller
than one are used to squish it. Scale is relative to the current element
size. If the element has been previously re-sized using scale then scale will
size relative to the new size. Multiple scale values may used.</p>
<p>
For example</p>
<pre>
 sphere { &lt;0,0,0&gt;, 1
  scale &lt;2,1,0.5&gt;
 }
</pre>

<p>will stretch and smash the sphere into an ellipsoid shape that is twice
the original size along the x-direction, remains the same size in the
y-direction and is half the original size in the z-direction.</p>
<p>
If a lone float expression is specified it is promoted to a three component
vector whose terms are all the same. Thus the item is uniformly scaled by the
same amount in all directions. For example:</p>
<pre>
 object {
  MyObject
  scale 5 // Evaluates as &lt;5,5,5&gt; so uniformly scale
      // by 5 in every direction.
 }
</pre>

<p>When one of the scaling components is zero, POV-Ray changes this
component to 1 since it assumes that 0 means no scaling in this
direction. A warning &quot;Illegal Value: Scale X, Y or Z by 0.0. Changed to
1.0.&quot; is printed then.</p>

</div>
<a name="t2_2_7_1_3"></a>
<div class="content-level-h5" contains="Rotate" id="t2_2_7_1_3">
<h5>2.2.7.1.3 Rotate</h5>
<p>You may change the orientation of an object or texture pattern by adding a
<code>rotate</code> modifier. It consists of the keyword <code> rotate</code>
followed by a vector expression. The three terms of the vector specify the
number of degrees to rotate about each of the x-, y- and z-axes.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> The order of the rotations does matter. Rotations occur about the
x-axis first, then the y-axis, then the z-axis. If you are not sure if this
is what you want then you should only rotate on one axis at a time using
multiple rotation statements to get a correct rotation.</p>
<pre>
 rotate &lt;0, 30, 0&gt;  // 30 degrees around Y axis then,
 rotate &lt;-20, 0, 0&gt; // -20 degrees around X axis then,
 rotate &lt;0, 0, 10&gt;  // 10 degrees around Z axis.
</pre>

<p>Rotation is always performed relative to the axis. Thus if an object is
some distance from the axis of rotation it will not only rotate but it will
<em>orbit</em> about the axis as though it was swinging around on an
invisible string.</p>
<p>
POV-Ray uses a left-handed rotation system. Using the famous
<em>Computer Graphics Aerobics</em> exercise, you hold up your
left hand and point your thumb in the positive direction of the axis of
rotation. Your fingers will curl in the positive direction of rotation.
Similarly if you point your thumb in the negative direction of the axis your
fingers will curl in the negative direction of rotation. See
<a href="t2_2.html#t2_2_1_1">Understanding POV-Ray's Coordinate System</a> for an illustration.</p>

</div>
<a name="t2_2_7_1_4"></a>
<div class="content-level-h5" contains="Matrix" id="t2_2_7_1_4">
<h5>2.2.7.1.4 Matrix</h5>
<p>The <code>matrix</code> keyword can be used to explicitly specify the
transformation matrix to be used for objects or textures. Its syntax is:</p>
<pre>
MATRIX:
    matrix &lt;Val00, Val01, Val02,
        Val10, Val11, Val12,
        Val20, Val21, Val22,
        Val30, Val31, Val32&gt;
</pre>

<p>Where <em><code>Val00</code></em> through <em><code>Val32</code></em> are
float expressions enclosed in angle brackets and separated by commas.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> This is not a vector. It is a set of 12 float expressions.</p>
<p> These floats specify the elements of a 4 by 4 matrix with the fourth column implicitly set
to <code>&lt;0,0,0,1&gt;</code>. At any given point <em>P, P=&lt;px, py,
pz&gt;</em>, is transformed into the point <em>Q, Q=&lt;qx, qy, qz&gt;</em>
by</p>

<p>qx = Val00 * px + Val10 * py + Val20 * pz + Val30</p>
<p>
qy = Val01 * px + Val11 * py + Val21 * pz + Val31</p>
<p>
qz = Val02 * px + Val12 * py + Val22 * pz + Val32</p>

<p>Normally you will not use the matrix keyword because it is less
descriptive than the transformation commands and harder to visualize. However
the matrix command allows more general transformation effects like <em>
shearing</em>. The following matrix causes an object to be sheared along the
y-axis.</p>
<pre>
 object {
  MyObject
  matrix &lt; 1, 1, 0,
       0, 1, 0,
       0, 0, 1,
       0, 0, 0 &gt;
 }

<a name="t2_2_7_2"></a>
<div class="content-level-h4" contains="Transformation Order" id="t2_2_7_2">
<h4>2.2.7.2 Transformation Order</h4>
<p>Because rotations are always relative to the axis and scaling is relative
to the origin, you will generally want to create an object at the origin and
scale and rotate it first. Then you may translate it into its proper position. It is
a common mistake to carefully position an object and then to decide to rotate it.
However because a rotation of an object causes it to orbit about the axis, the
position of the object may change so much that it orbits out of the field of view
of the camera!</p>
<p>Similarly scaling after translation also moves an object unexpectedly. If you
scale after you translate the scale will multiply the translate amount.
<br>For example</p>
<pre>
  translate &lt;5, 6, 7&gt;
  scale 4
</pre>

<p>will translate to <code>&lt;20,24,28&gt;</code> instead of <code>
&lt;5,6,7&gt;</code>. Be careful when transforming to get the order correct
for your purposes.</p>

<h4>2.2.7.3 Inverse Transform</h4>
<pre>
  transform { scale &lt;20,24,28&gt; translate y*3  inverse }
</pre>
<p>An inverse transform does the opposite of what the transform would 
normally do, and can be used to undo transforms without messing 
around with huge numbers of transformations. To do the same without this 
<code>inverse</code>, you would  have to duplicate each transform, change 
them to do the opposite of what they would normally do (for example
<code>translate -y*3</code> instead of <code>translate y*3</code>)and
reverse their order.</p>

</div>
<a name="t2_2_7_4"></a>
<div class="content-level-h4" contains="Transform Identifiers" id="t2_2_7_4">
<h4>2.2.7.4 Transform Identifiers</h4>
<p>At times it is useful to combine together several transformations and apply them
in multiple places. A transform identifier may be used for this purpose. Transform
identifiers are declared as follows:</p>
<pre>
TRANSFORM_DECLARATION:
  #declare IDENTIFIER = transform{ TRANSFORMATION... } |
  #local IDENTIFIER = transform{ TRANSFORMATION... }
</pre>

<p>Where <em>IDENTIFIER</em> is the name of the identifier up to 40 characters
long and <em>TRANSFORMATION</em> is any valid transformation modifier. See <a href="r3_3.html#r3_3_2_2_2">#declare vs. #local</a> for information on identifier scope. Here is an example...</p>
<pre>
  #declare MyTrans =
    transform {
      rotate THISWAY
      scale SOMUCH
      rotate -THISWAY
      scale BIGGER
      translate OVERTHERE
      rotate WAYAROUND
    }
</pre>

<p>A transform identifier is invoked by the <code>transform</code> keyword with
or without brackets as shown here:</p>
<pre>
  object {
    MyObject              // Get a copy of MyObject
    transform MyTrans     // Apply the transformation
    translate -x*5        // Then move it 5 units left
  }
  object {
    MyObject              // Get another copy of MyObject
    transform { MyTrans } // Apply the same transformation
    translate x*5         // Then move this one 5 units right
  }
</pre>

<p>On extremely complex CSG objects with lots of components it may speed up
parsing if you apply a declared transformation rather than the individual
<code>translate</code>, <code>rotate</code>, <code>scale</code>, or <code>
matrix</code> modifiers. The <code>transform</code> is attached just once to
each component. Applying each individual <code>translate</code>, <code>
rotate</code>, <code>scale</code>, or <code>matrix</code> modifiers takes
longer. This only affects parsing - rendering works the same either way.</p>

</div>
<a name="t2_2_7_5"></a>
<div class="content-level-h4" contains="Transforming Textures and Objects" id="t2_2_7_5">
<h4>2.2.7.5 Transforming Textures and Objects</h4>
<p>When an object is transformed all textures attached to the object <em>at
that time</em> are transformed as well. This means that if you have a <code>
translate</code>, <code>rotate</code>, <code>scale</code>, or <code>
matrix</code> modifier in an object <em>before</em> a texture, then the
texture will not be transformed. If the transformation is <em>after</em> the
texture then the texture will be transformed with the object. If the
transformation is <em>inside</em> the <code>texture</code> statement then
<em>only the texture</em> is affected. The shape remains the same. For
example:</p>
<pre>
 sphere { 0, 1
  texture { Jade } // texture identifier from TEXTURES.INC
  scale 3          // this scale affects both the
                   // shape and texture
 }
 sphere { 0, 1
  scale 3          // this scale affects the shape only
  texture { Jade }
 }
 sphere { 0, 1
  texture {
   Jade
   scale 3        // this scale affects the texture only
  }
 }
</pre>

<p>Transformations may also be independently applied to pigment patterns and
surface normal patterns.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> Scaling a normal pattern not only affects the width and spacing. It does also affect the apparent height or depth of the bumps, for how to avoid this see <a href="r3_6.html#r3_6_1_2_4">Scaling normals</a>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
 box { &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;, &lt;1, 1, 1&gt;
  texture {
   pigment {
    checker Red, White
    scale 0.25 // This affects only the color pattern
   }
   normal {
    bumps 0.3 // This specifies apparent height of bumps
    scale 0.2 // Scales diameter and space between bumps
              // and also the height. Has no effect on
              // color pattern.
   }
   rotate y*45 // This affects the entire texture but
  }            // not the object.

<h3>2.2.8 Setting POV-Ray Options</h3>
<p>
POV-Ray was originally created as a command-line program for operating
systems without graphical interfaces, dialog boxes and pull-down menus. Most
versions of POV-Ray still use command-line switches to tell it what to do.
This documentation assumes you are using the command-line version. All graphical
versions of POV-Ray provide a means of using command-line switches and INI files
from within the user interface, so you can use the below options in any version
of POV-Ray. There is system-specific documentation for each system describing which
of these commands are also able to be set via menus or dialogs.
</p>

<p>There are two distinct ways of setting POV-Ray options (other than through
the GUI interface, if applicable) : command line switches and INI file keywords.
Both are explained in detail in the following sections.</p>

several switches. Each switch begins with a plus or minus sign. The <code>
+I</code> switch with the filename tells POV-Ray what scene file it should
use as input and <code>+V</code> tells the program to output its status to
the text screen as it is working. The <code>+W</code> and <code> +H</code>
switches set the width and height of the image in pixels. This image will be
80 pixels wide by 60 pixels high.</p>
<p>
In switches which toggle a feature, the plus turns it on and minus turns it
off. For example <code> +P</code> turns on the <em>pause for keypress when
finished</em> option while <code>-P</code> turns it off. Other switches are
used to specify values and do not toggle a feature. Either plus or minus may
be used in that instance. For example <code>+W320</code> sets the width to
320 pixels. You could also use <code> -W320</code> and get the same
results.</p>
<p>
Switches may be specified in upper or lower case. They are read left to
right but in general may be specified in any order. If you specify a switch
more than once, the previous value is generally overwritten with the last
specification. The only exception is the <code>+L</code> switch for setting
library paths.</p>
<p>
Almost all <code> +</code> or <code>-</code> switches have an equivalent
option which can be used in an INI file which is described in the next
section. A detailed description of each switch is given in the option
reference section.</p>

<h4>2.2.8.2 Using INI Files</h4>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> Although the term 'INI file' is used by POV-Ray, this was implemented
before the widespread acceptance of Microsoft Windows, and while POV-Ray's INI files
are almost identical to those of Windows, there are some minor differences (the
foremost being that it is legal to have multiple instances of the same item in a
section). INI files are used on all platform versions of POV-Ray, not just on
the Windows platform.</p>

<p>Because it is difficult to set more than a few options on a command line,
you have the ability to put multiple options in one or more text files. These
initialization files or INI files have .ini as their default extension.
</p>
<p>
The majority of options you use will be stored in INI files. The command
line switches are recommended for options which you will turn off or on
frequently as you perform test renderings of a scene you are developing. The
file <code>povray.ini</code> is automatically read if present in the same
directory as the scene; most platforms also have platform-specific INI files
that are read prior to <code>povray.ini</code>. You may also 
specify additional INI files on the command-line by simply typing the file
name on the command line. For example:</p>
<pre>
  povray myopts.ini
</pre>

<p>If no extension is given, then <code>.ini</code> is assumed. POV-Ray knows
this is not a switch because it is not preceded by a plus or minus.</p>
<p>
You may have multiple INI files on the command line along with switches. For
example:</p>
<pre>
  povray myopts +V other
</pre>

<p>This reads options from <code>myopts.ini</code>, then sets the <code>
+V</code> switch, then reads options from <code>other.ini</code>.</p>
<p>
An INI file is a plain ASCII text file with options of the form...</p>
<pre>
  Option_keyword=VALUE ; Text after semicolon is a comment
</pre>

<p>For example the INI equivalent of the switch <code>+Isimple.pov</code>
is...</p>
<pre>
  Input_File_Name=simple.pov
</pre>

<p>Options are read top to bottom in the file but in general may be specified in any order. If you specify an option more than once, the previous values are generally overwritten with the last specification. The only exception is the <code>Library_Path=path</code> option.</p>
<p>
Almost all INI-style options have equivalent <code>+</code> or <code>
-</code> switches. The option reference section gives a detailed description
of all POV-Ray options. It includes both the INI-style settings and the
<code>+</code>/<code>-</code> switches.</p>
<p>
The INI keywords are not case sensitive. Only one INI option is permitted
per line of text. You may also include switches in your INI file if they are
easier for you. You may have multiple switches per line but you should not
mix switches and INI options on the same line. You may nest INI files by
simply putting the file name on a line by itself with no equals sign after
it. Nesting may occur up to ten levels deep. For example:</p>
<pre>
  ; This is a sample INI file. This entire line is a comment.
  ; Blank lines are permitted.
  Input_File_Name=simple.pov ;This sets the input file name
  +W80 +H60 ; Traditional +/- switches are permitted too
  MOREOPT   ; Read MOREOPT.INI and continue with next line
  +V        ; Another switch
  ; That's all folks!
</pre>

<p>INI files may have labeled sections so that more than one set of options
may be stored in a single file. Each section begins with a label in []
brackets. For example:</p>
<pre>
  ; RES.INI
  ; This sample INI file is used to set resolution.
  +W120 +H100  ; This section has no label.
               ; Select it with &quot;RES&quot;
  [Low]
  +W80 +H60    ; This section has a label.
               ; Select it with &quot;RES[Low]&quot;
  [Med]
  +W320 +H200  ; This section has a label.
               ; Select it with &quot;RES[Med]&quot;
  [High]
  +W640 +H480  ; Labels are not case sensitive.
               ; &quot;RES[high]&quot; works
  [Really High]
  +W800 +H600  ; Labels may contain blanks
</pre>

<p>When you specify the INI file you should follow it with the section label
in brackets. For example...</p>
<pre>
  povray res[Med] +Imyfile.pov
</pre>

<p>POV-Ray reads <code>res.ini</code> and skips all options until it finds
the label <code>Med</code>. It processes options after that label until it
finds another label and then it skips. If no label is specified on the
command line then only the unlabeled area at the top of the file is read. If
a label is specified, the unlabeled area is ignored.</p>

<p class="Note"><b>Note:</b> If your shell treats '[' or ']' specially you may need to escape them.</p>

<p>If a file or path contains blanks the whole file and path specification has
to be put in quotes. You may either use a double-quote or a single-quote, but
you have to use the same at the beginning and end. For example:</p>
<pre>
 +I&quot;my file.pov&quot;
 +I'my file.pov'
 Input_File=&quot;my file.pov&quot;
 Input_File='my file.pov'
</pre>

<p>By using either single or double quotes it is possible to specify files
whose name or path contains either as part of the name. For example:</p>
<pre>
 +I&quot;file's.pov&quot;
 +I'my &quot;big&quot; file.pov'
 Input_File=&quot;file's.pov&quot;
 Input_File='my &quot;big&quot; file.pov'
</pre>

<div class="content-level-h4" contains="Using the POVINI Environment Variable" id="t2_2_8_3">
<h4>2.2.8.3 Using the POVINI Environment Variable</h4>
<p>On some platforms the environment variable POVINI is used to specify the location and name
of a default INI file that is read every time POV-Ray is executed. The Unix and Linux versions
of POV-Ray, for example, support this whilst the Windows version does not.</p>
<p>If POVINI is not specified, or if your computer platform does not use environment
variables, a default INI file may be read; see your platform-specific documentation for information.
</p>

<p>On most operating systems the sequence of reading options is as
follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read options from default INI file specified by the POVINI environment
variable or platform specific INI file.</li>
<li>Read switches from command line (this includes reading any specified INI files).</li>
</ol>

<p class="Note"><b>Note:</b> The POVRAYOPT environment variable supported by some earlier POV-Ray versions is no longer available.</p>
