@page styleguide2  Nitpicker's Coding Styleguide


To avoid boring you to death with coding rules, we decided to not include the following in our main coding styleguide
for one or more of the following reasons:

  - They deal with special cases.
  - They can, in our view, be taken for granted.
  - They are of lesser importance to us.
  - They can be easily checked for, and con-compliant code can easily be fixed.

We don't really expect you to actually read the following; if you have the stamina though, and want to learn more about
good coding practices, be our guest. These rules are heavily inspired by the Motor Industry Software Reliability
Association's publication "MISRA C++:2008 -- Guidelines for the use of the C++ language in critical systems", an
industry-wide accepted standard for writing robust C++ code. (However, if you're reading the source code of this
documentation page, be aware that the HTML comments citing individual MISRA rules are included for reference only, and
that our rules may differ substantially.)


@note
    Entries in parentheses are placeholders for concerns we haven't addressed yet. Most of these
    correspond to rules from the MISRA C++ 2008 guidelines.

@todo
    Flesh out the placeholders.

  - **Unused or useless code**: There should generally be no unreachable, orphaned, dead or
    pointless code, nor any unused variables or types. The following are valid exceptions:
      - Some feature needs to be disabled for a hotfix, and is intended to be re-enabled as soon as
        a proper fix has been implemented.
      - Helper code is already being developed (or being retained from dropped features) in
        anticipation of a feature that will use it.
      .
    In any case, the rationale for dragging along such unused code should be well documented in the
    source code.
    <!-- MISRA C++ 2008 **required** rules 0-1-1...0-1-6, 0-1-8...0-1-12, 14-7-1 -->

  - **Unused return values**: Whenever the return value of a function is ignored, it must be
    explicitly cast to `(void)` to indicate that this is intentional.
    <!-- MISRA C++ 2008 **required** rule 0-1-7 -->

  - **Unions**: Never use unions. Any deviation from this rule needs an exceptionally strong reason
    for it.
    <!-- MISRA C++ 2008 **required** rules 0-2-1, 9-5-1 -->

  - **Run-Time Checks**: When writing code, give thought to possible run-time errors, such as
    arithmetic errors (numeric overflow, division by zero, limits of floating-point precision,
    etc.), failed memory allocations, or bogus parameter values. Most notably, if a called function
    may indicate an error, make sure to test for that error indication and handle it appropriately.
    <!-- MISRA C++ 2008 document rule 0-3-1 (c), **required** rule 0-3-2 -->

    <!-- MISRA C++ 2008 document rule 0-4-1 (Use of scaled-integer or fixed-point arithmetic shall be documented)
         IGNORED: We're not using any of these... or are we? -->
    <!-- MISRA C++ 2008 document rule 0-4-2 (Use of floating-point arithmetic shall be documented)
         IGNORED: We're using floating-points virtually everywhere, and can't do without for obvious reasons. -->
    <!-- MISRA C++ 2008 document rule 0-4-3 (Floating-point implementations shall comply with a defined floating-point
         standard)
         IGNORED: This depends on the user's choice of compiler, and is therefore beyond the scope of any
         platform-independent project. -->

  - **Language Standard**: Source code should be written in C++ adhering to the ISO-IEC 14882-2003 standard (aka C++03).
    Compiler-specific language extensions may only be used in the dedicated headers intended to _hide_ compiler-specific
    implementation details.
    <!-- MISRA C++ 2008 **required** rule 1-0-1 -->

    <!-- MISRA C++ 2008 document rule 1-0-2 (Multiple compilers shall only be used if they have a common, defined
         interface)
         IGNORED: This depends on the user's choice of compiler, and is therefore beyond the scope of any
         platform-independent project. -->

  - **Negative Integer Division**: Source code should avoid division or modulus operations on
    negative integers, or should not rely on a particular rounding mode (towards negative infinity
    or towards zero) in such cases.
    <!-- MISRA C++ 2008 document rule 1-0-3 -->

  - **Character Encoding**: Source files should be plain vanilla ASCII, and should not use _universal character name
    notation_ (`\uXXXX` or `\UXXXXXXXX`). String literals should not encode any non-ASCII character by means of escape
    sequences.
    <!-- MISRA C++ 2008 document rule 2-2-1 -->

  - **Tri- and Digraphs**: Neither tri- nor digraphs should be used in the source code. Multiple
    consecutive question marks (`??`) in string literals should be escaped (`?\?`) to prevent the
    compiler from interpreting them as trigraphs.
    <!-- MISRA C++ 2008 **required** rule 2-3-1, advisory rule 2-5-1 -->

  - **Comments**: Do not nest block quotes; as a matter of fact, do not use `/*` in any comment
    (neither block nor single-line style).
    <!-- MISRA C++ 2008 **required** rule 2-7-1 -->
  - Do not use comments (neither block nor single-line style) to disable code.
    <!-- MISRA C++ 2008 **required** rule 2-7-2, advisory rule 2-7-3 -->

  - **Identifier Names**: We expect any sane developer to be using a fixed-pitch font with reasonably
    discernable characters, including (but not limited to) the notorious lowercase letter `l` and
    digit `1`. However, try to avoid cryptic identifiers with a high percentage of such problematic
    characters. Well, actually, better avoid _any_ cryptic identifiers.
    <!-- MISRA C++ 2008 **required** rule 2-10-1 -->
  - Avoid name collisions with identifiers in an outer scope ("shadowing").

  - (if an identifier refers to a type, it shall not also refer to an object or a function in the same scope) <!-- MISRA C++ 2008 **required** rule 2-10-6 -->
  .

  - **Escape Sequences**: Do not use any non-standard escape sequences.
    <!-- MISRA C++ 2008 **required** rule 2-13-1 -->

  - **Octal Constants**: Do not use octal constants or octal escape sequences.
    <!-- MISRA C++ 2008 **required** rule 2-13-2 -->

  - **Hexadecimal Constants**: When using hexadecimal constants, always explicitly specify them as
    signed or unsigned by append either a `u` or `s` suffix.
